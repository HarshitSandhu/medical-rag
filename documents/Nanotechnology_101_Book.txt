Series Foreword
What should you know about science? Because science is so central to
life in the twenty-first century, science educators believe that it is essential that everyone understand the basic foundations of the most vital and
far-reaching scientific disciplines. Science 101 helps you reach that goal—
this series provides readers of all abilities with an accessible summary
of the ideas, people, and impacts of major fields of scientific research.
The volumes in the series provide readers—whether students new to the
science or just interested members of the lay public—with the essentials
of a science using a minimum of jargon and mathematics. In each volume, more complicated ideas build upon simpler ones, and concepts
are discussed in short, concise segments that make them more easily understood. In addition, each volume provides an easy-to-use glossary and
annotated references and resources of the most useful and accessible
print and electronic resources that are currently available.

Preface
OVERVIEW
Nanotechnology: A 21st-Century Technology
Nanotechnology is the ability to observe, measure, manipulate, and
manufacture things at the nanometer scale, the size of atoms and
molecules.

The National Science Foundation predicts that the global marketplace for goods and services using nanotechnologies will be worth a
trillion dollars by 2015. In the same year, career opportunities in this
fast-paced technology will require 2–5 million semiskilled and skilled
employees worldwide. Nanotechnology has the potential to affect everything from the clothes we wear, to the energy we use, to the way we
detect and treat cancer and other diseases.
Nanotechnology 101 is a reference book and an excellent research tool
for developing a working knowledge of basic nanotechnology concepts
and topics. Besides the potential benefits of nanotechnology, the legal,
ethical, and social issues are also addressed.
In recent years, there have been several nanotechnology surveys that
have found that a majority of the adults know little or nothing about
nanotechnology. Therefore, in an effort to make the book more accessible and appealing to a broad range of readers, Nanotechnology 101
incorporates many features and enhancements that include:
r Current Nanotech Topics. This book provides all of the basic concepts
and topics of nanotechnology. In its comprehensive, easy-to-read format,
Nanotechnology 101 covers nanotechnology’s influence in medicine, engineering, economics, electronics, communications, energy, environment,
transportation, space travel, and homeland security.

Preface

r Bibliography. An excellent listing of reading materials at the end of each
chapter and in the appendix is provided.
r Interviews. This book also features more than 15 interviews with people
who work and study in the nanotechnology field. The interviews include
a nanotechnology business owner, an electrical engineer, a physics professor, an environmentalist, a chemistry teacher, and two high school
students who were winners of an NSTA nanotechnology project.

r Companies and Products. General information and Web sites for more
than 100 companies who are involved in cutting-edge nanotechnology
research and nanofabrication have been presented to the reader. Some of
these companies include IBM, Intel, Samsung, Eastman Kodak, Dupont,
and Hitachi High Technologies.
r Career Information. It encourages young people to explore the possibilities of a career in the nanotechnology field by providing resources they
can contact to learn more about career opportunities in the field. As an
example, Penn State provides a free CD, Careers in Nanofabrication.
r Video Sources. To enhance the text, Nanotechnology 101 provides more
than 80 nanotechnology video Web sites. As an example, Is Nanotechnology
Going to be the Next Industrial Revolution? Conversations in Science, Madison
Metropolitan School District, UW-Madison Interdisciplinary Education
Group. If you would like to view the video go to: http://mrsec.wisc.edu/
Edetc/cineplex/MMSD/nano5.html
r Hands-on Activities and Suggested Projects. There are suggestions and
opportunities for students and teachers to explore nano activities. As an
example, students can make a nanometer ruler, construct a Buckyball
R
model of an atomic force microscope. Want
model, and build a LEGO
to know how a scanning electron microscope works? Students can access
NASA’s electron microscope virtual lab Web site.
r Government and Nongovernment Resources. All of the major government agencies that are conducting nanotechnology research and funding
are included. Familiar names include Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA. Many nongovernment groups are
listed as well. This list includes such organizations as, Foresight Institute,
Nanotech Institute, Nano Science and Technology Institute, NanoBusiness Alliance, Institute of Technology, and Nanotech.
r Nanotechnology Timeline of Events. The timeline provides an opportunity to trace some of the important events of the history of nanotechnology.
r University and College Resources. Nanotechnology 101 includes nanotech
resource links and Web sites from more than 20 colleges and universities
that provide nanotechnology educational and outreach programs devoted
to middle school or high school students. By contacting these college sites,

students and teachers can access interactive activities, lesson plans, online
exhibits, experiments, games, and video broadcasts.

r National Science Education Standards. The content in the book provides
a close alignment with the National Science Education Standards. Nanotechnology is not a traditional discipline, but rather a combination of disciplines involving physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, engineering,
and technology. Nanotechnology 101 provides information in the appendix
that links nanotechnology concepts with those science education standards in each of the major science fields.
RICHARD E. SMALLEY (1943–2005)

To many people, Richard Smalley was the foremost leader in nanotechnology. He has often been noted as the “Father of Nanotechnology.”
Richard Smalley was a Rice University professor who won a Nobel
Prize in chemistry in 1996. He is well known for his work with carbon
nanotubes (known as the “Buckyballs”).
In the spring of 1999, Professor Smalley addressed the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space. Testifying at the meetings,
he had called for congressional support of a National Nanotechnology
Initiative (NNI) that could double U.S. Federal funding for nanoscale
research and development efforts over the next 3 years, to about $460
million.
In 1999, while Professor Richard Smalley was testifying before the
Congress, he had also been fighting leukemia for over a year. At one
meeting, he had the opportunity to speak about the medical applications
of nanotechnology. Here is an excerpt of what he had to say.
I sit before you today with very little hair on my head. It fell out a few weeks
ago as a result of the chemotherapy I’ve been undergoing to treat a type of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. While I am very optimistic, this chemotherapy is a
very blunt tool. It consists of small molecules, which are toxic—they kill cells
in my body. Although they are meant to kill only the cancer cells, they kill hair
cells too, and cause all sorts of other havoc.
Now, I’m not complaining. Twenty years ago, without even this crude
chemotherapy, I would already be dead. But 20 years from now, I am confident
we will no longer have to use this blunt tool. By then, nanotechnology will
have given us specially engineered drugs, which are nanoscale cancer-seeking
missiles, a molecular technology that specifically targets just the mutant cancer cells in the human body and leaves everything else blissfully alone. . . .
I may not live to see it. But, with your help, I am confident it will happen.
Cancer—at least the type that I have—will be a thing of the past.

Preface

Richard Smalley died of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma on October 2005.
In 1999, the Rice University Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) was renamed the Richard E. Smalley Institute for
Nanoscale Science and Technology in his honor.
Note: Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the nation’s sixth leading cause of cancer
death. The American Cancer Society predicted that there would be about 6,300 new
cases of NHL in this country in 2007. About 18,000 people die of this disease each
year.

What Is
Nanotechnology?
INTRODUCTION

A patron at a local restaurant spills coffee on his trousers. The liquid
beads up and rolls off without leaving a spot on his clothing.
The U.S. Golf Association suggests that golfers can now use new golf
balls that fly straighter, with less wobble, than normal golf balls.
A woman is using a new variety of canola oil in preparing her meals.
The oil contains tiny particles that block cholesterol from entering her
bloodstream.
Walking down a street in London, England, a pedestrian suddenly
smells that the air is cleaner. The sidewalk is treated with a special
product that breaks down harmful pollutants in the air.
The air purifying pavement, the new golf balls, the nonstain pants, are
just some of the examples of products produced by nanotechnology, a
key technology for the 21st century. Nanotechnology offers cutting-edge
applications that will revolutionize the way we detect and treat disease,
monitor and protect the environment, produce and store energy, improve crop production and food quality, and build complex structures
as small as an electronic circuit or as large as an airplane.
WHAT IS NANOTECHNOLOGY?

Nanotechnology is the ability to observe, measure, manipulate, and
manufacture things at the nanometer scale. A nanometer (nm) is an
SI (Système International d’Unités) unit of length 10−9 or a distance of
one-billionth of a meter. That’s very small. At this scale, you are talking
about the size of atoms and molecules.
To create a visual image of a nanometer, observe the nail on your
little finger. The width of your nail on this finger is about 10 million

nanometers across. To get a sense of some other nano-scaled objects, a
strand of human hair is approximately 75,000 to 100,000 nanometers
in diameter. A head of a pin is about a million nanometers wide and it
would take about 10 hydrogen atoms end-to-end to span the length of
one nanometer.
The word “nanotechnology” was first introduced in the late 1970s.
While many definitions for nanotechnology exist, most groups use the
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) definition. The NNI calls
something “nanotechnology” only if it involves all of the following:
r Research and technology development at the atomic, molecular, or macromolecular levels, in the length scale of approximately 1 to 100-nanometer
range.
r Creating and using structures, devices, and systems that have novel
properties and functions because of their small and/or intermediate
size.
r Ability to control or manipulate on the atomic scale.

See Chapter 8 for more information about the National Nanotechnology
Initiative.
Please note that nanotechnology is not merely the study of small
things. Nanotechnology is the research and development of materials, devices, and systems that exhibit physical, chemical, and biological
properties. These properties can be different from those found at larger
scales—those that are more than 100 nanometers.

What Is Nanotechnology?

Living with Nanoparticles

You live with nanoparticles every day. In a normal room, there are
about 15,000 nanoparticles per cubic centimeter in the air. If you
are taking a walk in the forest, you will be in an environment where
there will be about 50,000 nanoparticles per cubic centimeter. In a
large city, there can be about 100,000 nanoparticles per cubic centimeter (cm3 ).

NANOTECHNOLOGY WILL DEVELOP IN STAGES

Dr. Mihail Roco is a senior advisor on nanotechnology to the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and coordinator of the NNI. Dr. Roco believes that nanotechnology will have several phases of development. He
states that we are now in the second phase. The first one consisted of using nanostructures, simple nanoparticles, designed to perform one task.
The second phase started in 2005. In the second phase, researchers have
discovered ways to precisely construct nanoscale building blocks. The
blocks can be assembled into flat or curved structures such as bundles,
sheets, and tubes. These structures hold promise for new and powerful drug delivery systems, electronic circuits, catalysts, and light energy
sources.
By 2010, Dr. Roco says, the third phase will arrive, featuring nanosystems with thousands of interacting components. A few years after that,
the first “molecular” nanodevices will appear. These devices will be composed of systems within systems operating much like a human cell works.
One of the main reasons why there is a lot more activity in producing
nanotechnology products today than before is because there are now
many new kinds of tools. These new tools consisting of special scanning electron microscopes and atomic force microscopes can measure,
see, and manipulate nanometer-sized particles. See Chapter 3 for more
information about nanotechnology tools.
NANOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS

What kinds of nanoproducts are available now?
More than $32 billion in products containing nanomaterials were
sold globally in 2005. As was stated earlier, the global marketplace for
goods and services using nanotechnologies will grow to $1 trillion by
2015. However, other financial experts predict that the marketplace for
nanoproducts will reach $2.6 trillion in manufactured goods by 2014.
Presently, there are more than 200 companies that market and sell
products using nanotechnology applications. Many of these companies
produce much of the 700 or so nanoproducts that are currently available
in the U.S. marketplace. Let’s review a few examples of nanoproducts
that are available today.
Sporting Goods

Special nanoparticles made of carbon are used to stiffen areas of the
racquet head and shaft. The particles are 100 times more rigid than steel
and 6 times lighter. The new composite hockey stick developed is more

Nano tennis balls coated internally with a nano-sized membrane, slow

Car Paint and Car Waxes

There are now new kinds of automobile paints, developed from nanotechnology, that have improved scratch-resistant qualities compared to
conventional car paint. Nano car waxes, made with nano-sized polishing
agents, provide a better shine due to its ability to fill-in tiny blemishes in
automotive paint finishes.
Antibacterial Cleansers

There are several antibacterial cleansers that use nanoemulsion technology to kill pathogens. The cleansers are able to kill tuberculosis and
bacteria while remaining nonflammable, noncorrosive, and nontoxic.
The good news is that there are no harmful effects when using these
products.
Medical Bandages

require fewer painful changings of dressings than previous silver

Apparel Industry

Several clothing companies have marketed new brands of nonstain
nanotechnology fabrics. The fabric resists spills from many types of fibers
(cotton, synthetics, wool, silk, rayon, and polypropylene). The fabric
also repels a range of liquids including beverages and salad dressings.
These fabrics keep the body cool and comfortable and have an antistatic
treatment that reduces static cling from dog hair, lint, and dust. See
Chapter 6 for more information about nanotechnology fabrics.

What Is Nanotechnology?

Sunscreens and Cosmetics

Several cosmetic companies have already marketed a number of products that include nanotechnology. The products include sunscreens, deodorants, and antiaging creams. One sunscreen product uses zinc oxide
nanoparticles that protects the skin but does not leave white marks on
the skin. However, more regulation of some of these products will be
needed because of the limited research that has been carried out in this
still new field. See Chapter 6 for more information about sunscreens.
Organic Light-Emitting Displays or OLEDs

The OLEDs are ultrathin displays manufactured by sandwiching extremely thin (often nano-sized) layers of organic polymer light-emitting
materials between electrodes. These images are bright and viewable at
wide angles. The displays are smaller and of lighter weight than traditional LCD (liquid crystal display) displays—meaning they are ideally
suited to mobile electronics, such as digital cameras, cellular phones,
and handheld computers.
FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY

What can we look for in future applications of nanotechnology?
Environment

Emerging nanotechnologies hold great promise for creating new
means of detecting air pollutants, and cleaning polluted waste streams
and groundwater. A research group is now testing the use of magnetic
nanoparticles that can absorb and trap organic contaminants in water. If
the testing continually succeeds, the process can also be very effective in
cleaning up contaminated Superfund sites—hazardous and toxic waste
sites—in the United States. See Chapter 8 for more information about
the environment.
Solar Energy

Researchers are making an effort to find a lower-cost source of household energy for the nation’s future. They are exploring the creation
of nanoscale devices on the molecular level that can convert sunlight
into electric current. Scientists have invented a plastic solar cell that
can turn the sun’s power into electrical energy, even on a cloudy day.
The plastic material uses nanotechnology and contains solar cells able
to harness the sun’s invisible, infrared rays. Like paint, the composite

can be sprayed onto other materials and used as a portable source of
electricity. A sweater coated in the material could power a cell phone or
other wireless devices.
However, the idea of using nanostructures to convert sunlight into
electricity is still theoretical. The main concern is that the present cost
of electricity produced by solar cells is four times greater than electricity
produced by nuclear or fossil fuels. Many companies and government
agencies are funding much research in solar projects, which indicates
there is an increasing interest in this field by the scientific community
and corporations. See Chapter 8 for more information about solar cells.
Fuel Cells

Several companies are utilizing nanostructure technology to help develop high performance fuel cells for use in automobiles, portable consumer electronics such as laptop computers, cell phones, and digital
cameras. A fuel cell is an energy conversion device and alternative to
batteries that converts energy from a chemical reaction into electricity
and heat. Fuel cells combine fuels such as hydrogen or methanol along
with air and water to produce electrical power. Because their by-products
are heat and water, fuel cells are environmentally friendly. See Chapter 8 for more information about fuel cells.
Food and Agriculture

The ability to use nanotechnology will allow food companies to design and provide food products that would be safer, cheaper, and
more sustainable than the foods today. Food companies will also use
less water and chemicals in the preparation and production of food
products.
One food company had developed nanosensors that would be embedded in food packaging. A color change in the nanosensor would alert
the consumer if a food in the package had become contaminated or if it
had begun to spoil. Some companies are producing a plastic consisting
of clay nanoparticles. The nanoparticles in the plastic are able to block
out oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture from spoiling fresh meats
and other foods. See Chapter 7 for more information about food and
agriculture.
Automobiles and Aeronautics

Nanoscale powders and nanoparticles will be able to enhance the
physical properties of automobile, aircraft, watercraft, trains, and

spacecraft. Planes, trains, and automobiles will be lighter, faster, and
more fuel-efficient and constructed of lighter, stronger materials. Some
of these lightweight materials will include aluminum bodies for automobiles, brake systems for high-speed trains, and quieter aircraft engines.
The stronger, lighter materials will help in energy efficiency and reducing mass and weight of finished products. See Chapter 6 for more
information about automobiles and aircraft.
Medical Applications

Many medical procedures could be handled by nanomachines that
rebuild arteries, rebuild bones, and reinforce bones. In cancer nanotechnology research, scientists are testing and experimenting with new
ideas to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer in the future.
One research medical team is using nanoshells to target cancer cells.
Nanoshells are hollow silica spheres covered with gold. In animal testing, Naomi Halas’s research team at Rice University directed infrared
radiation through tissue and onto the shells, causing the gold to superheat and destroy tumor cells while leaving healthy ones intact. Human
clinical trials using gold nanoshells are slated to begin within a few
years.
Another cancer research team has shown that the targeted gold
nanoparticles combined with lasers can kill oral cancer cells. Oral cancer is any cancerous tissue growth located in the mouth. Smoking and
other tobacco use are associated with 70–80 percent of oral cancer cases.
Thirty thousand Americans will be diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal
cancer this year. See Chapter 5 for more information about the medical
field.
Lab-on-a-Chip

In other nano medical news, researchers are studying lab-on-a-chip
technology. Lab-on-a-chip technology consists of a portable handheld
device containing a simple computer chip that can diagnose and monitor the medical conditions of a patient. As an example, a tiny sample
of blood placed on the device could diagnose if the patient is diabetic.
The lab-on-a-chip could be used for commercial, medical diagnostic applications, such as an in-office test for strep throat, or modern in-home
pregnancy tests.
NASA has customized lab-on-a-chip technology to protect future space
explorers. The lab-on-a-chip would be used to monitor the health of the
crew by detecting contaminants in the spacecraft.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
RESEARCH

Nanotechnology is expected to have large impact on many sectors of
the world’s economy. A strong nanotechnology economy can lead to new
products, new businesses, new jobs, and even new industries for many
countries. As a result, nanotechnology funding for research is growing
rapidly all over.
In 2001, President Clinton requested a major new initiative in the 2002
federal budget, called the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).
The budget included an increase of more than 200 million dollars for
the government’s investment in nanotechnology research and development. In December 2003, President Bush signed the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, which authorized funding for nanotechnology research and development (R&D) over 4 years, starting in
FY 2005. This legislation puts into law programs and activities supported
by the National Nanotechnology Initiative.
The 2003 bill authorized nearly $3.7 billion for research and development programs coordinated among several federal agencies. The
legislation also authorized public hearings and expert advisory panels,
as well as the American Nanotechnology Preparedness Center to study
the emerging technology’s potential societal and ethical effects.
Other Countries Are Also Investing in Nanotechnology Research

The United States is not the only country to recognize the tremendous economic potential of nanotechnology. In 2007, the Russian government planned to take its export revenues from oil and gas sales and
invest it in nanotechnology research and development. During the next
3 years, Russia will invest more than $1 billion in nanotechnology so that
it can become less dependent on raw materials.
Brazil had a projected budget for nanoscience during 2004 to 2007
that included creating three institutions, four networks, and recruiting
300 scientists to work in nanotechnology research. Some of the Brazilian researchers are interested in the use of magnetic nanoparticles to
remove oil from oil spills and then be able to recycle the nanoparticles
and the oil. Other countries pursuing nanotechnology include Thailand, Philippines, Chile, Israel, Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Japan,
China, and Korea, as well as several European countries.
WHAT DO AMERICANS THINK OF NANOTECHNOLOGY?

So, what do Americans think about this technology? In 2004, North
Carolina State University researchers conducted a survey designed to

find out about the public’s perceptions of nanotechnology. The telephone survey polled a random sample of 1,536 adults in the continental
United States in the spring of 2004 as a part of a larger research project
studying public perceptions of nanotechnology. What follows are some
of their findings.
r More than 80 percent of the adults indicated they had heard “little” or
“nothing” about nanotechnology. Most of them could not correctly answer
factual questions about it. However, despite knowing very little about the
science, 40 percent of the respondents predicted nanotechnology would
produce more benefits than risks. Another 38 percent believed risks and
benefits of nanotechnology would be about equal, and only 22 percent
said the risks would outweigh the benefits.
r Approximately 70 percent of those surveyed said they were “somewhat”
or “very” hopeful about nanotechnology, while 80 percent said they were
not worried at all about the science. Only 5 percent said they felt angry
about the science.
r Respondents were also asked to choose the most important potential
benefit from nanotechnology. A majority (57 percent) cited “new and
better ways to detect and treat human diseases.” Sixteen percent selected
“new and better ways to clean up the environment”; 12 percent chose
“increased national security and defense capabilities”; and 11 percent
identified ways to “improve human physical and mental abilities” as the
most important benefit.
r In choosing which potential risk was the most important to avoid, most
respondents (32 percent) picked “losing personal privacy to tiny new
surveillance devices.” Others wanted to avoid “a nanotechnology inspired
arms race” (24 percent); “breathing nano-sized particles that accumulate
in your body” (19 percent); “economic disruption caused by the loss of
traditional jobs.”

Nanotechnology, contact North Carolina State University.
WILL NANOTECHNOLOGY BE USED TO HELP PEOPLE
IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?

The applications of nanotechnology will certainly benefit all the developed countries. But will this new technology help the developing
countries—those nations that have limited resources and whose people
live in poor conditions? To answer the question, the Canadian Program
on Genomics and Global Health (CPGGH) has a plan to assist those
developing countries.

The GPGGH is a leading international group that studies nanotechnology applications. They advocate that nanotechnology applications will help people in developing countries tackle their most urgent problems. Some of these problems include extreme poverty and
hunger, child mortality, environmental degradation, and diseases, such
as malaria and HIV/AIDS.
The goals of the CPGGH identified and ranked several nanotechnology applications most likely to have an impact in the developing world.
The top five nanotechnology applications on the list included:
1. Energy storage, production, and conversion
2. Agricultural productivity enhancement
3. Water treatment and remediation—cleaning up waste sites
4. Disease diagnosis and screening
5. Drug delivery systems

The CPGGH group selected energy as the number one priority in nanotechnology applications to assist developing countries. They included
energy production, conversion and storage, along with creation of alternative fuels, as the energy areas where nanotechnology applications are
most likely to benefit developing countries.
Number two on the list is agriculture. They state that science can
be used to develop a range of inexpensive nanotech applications to
increase soil fertility and crop production, and help eliminate malnutrition. Malnutrition is a contributor to more than half the deaths
of children under five in developing countries. Other agricultural
developments include nanosensors to monitor the health of crops
and farm animals and magnetic nanoparticles to remove soil contaminants.
Water treatment is third-ranked by the panel. One-sixth of the world’s
population lacks access to safe water supplies, according to their study
group. More than one-third of the population of rural areas in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America has no clean water. Two million children die
each year from water-related diseases, such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, and schistosomiasis, which result from a lack of adequate water
sources and sanitation. Nanomembranes and nanoclays are inexpensive,
portable, and easily cleaned systems that purify, detoxify, and desalinate
water more efficiently than conventional bacterial and viral filters. These
water treatment processes could provide potable water for families and
communities.

Disease diagnosis and screening was ranked fourth. Some of these
technologies include inexpensive, handheld diagnostic kits that detect
the presence of several pathogens at once and could be used for widerange screening in small clinics.
Drug delivery system was fifth on the list. Nanotechnology could improve transportation costs by developing drugs to last longer in storage.
Most drugs today have a short shelf life because of changes in humidity
and temperature change in storage rooms.
THE NANOTECHNOLOGY JOB MARKET
The Need for Workers

Many jobs will be needed to fill in the vacancies for nanotechnology. The National Science Foundation (“NSF”) projects that the nanotechnology job market in the United States will require over 2 million nanotechnology-savvy workers by 2014. The NSF therefore is calling for children between the ages of 10 and 17 to be educated now
about the field that will define their job market as adults. Of the
2 million nanotechnology-savvy workers required by 2014, 20 percent
are expected to be scientists, with the remaining 80 percent consisting of highly skilled engineers, technicians, business leaders, and
economists.
Dr. Mihail Roco, mentioned earlier in this chapter, states that as nanotechnology moves into the mainstream, companies building products
at the atomic level eventually will face a serious shortage of talent—
far worse than what is already occurring. Dr. Roco estimated, about
2 million nanotech-trained workers will be needed to support growing
industries and the startups they spawn within the next 10 to 15 years,
He emphasized that the country needs to find ways to motivate students
about sciences and to make them aware of the career opportunities in
nanotechnology fields.
UNIVERSITIES OFFER NANOTECHNOLOGY YOUTH PROGRAMS

To motivate students to explore careers in nanotechnology, many colleges and universities have presented a variety of programs for middle
school and high school students. These schools offer nanotechnology
camps, school outreach programs, field trips, and nanotechnology career days for students from city, suburban, and private schools. Some of
these universities and colleges include Georgia Institute of Technology,
Penn State, University of California, Santa Barbara, Cornell, University

the field that is “leading to the next industrial revolution.” See Chapter
10 to learn more about how schools, universities, colleges, and other organizations are encouraging young people to explore nanotechnology.
THE FIELDS OF STUDY THAT INFLUENCE NANOTECHNOLOGY

Anyone who explores a career in nanotechnology will learn that it is
a multidisciplinary field. Some of these fields include physics, mechanical engineering, chemistry, biology, medicine, business and economics,
agricultural science, electronics, computer science, environmental science, and law and ethics.
Chemistry, biology, and physics are the major science nanotechnology
fields of study. These fields can provide candidates with a solid foundation for any of a broad range of nanotechnology careers.
Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes matter undergoes.
Nanotechnology uses chemistry extensively in the field of molecular
devices and molecular manipulation.
The chemistry in nanotechnology is a bit different from the traditional chemistry courses. The chemistry in nanotechnology deals with
the manipulation of atoms and molecules of chemicals. Synthesizing
a chemical with nanotechnology means building something atom by
atom. This process is quite different from traditional chemistry that
usually studies materials at the macro or larger scale—more than 100
nanometers.
The traditional biology courses involve the study of the molecular structure and function of living systems. These systems range from cells
and bacteria to spiders and humans. All of these organisms rely on
nanometer-sized proteins or molecular motors to do everything from
cell division to moving a leg. An application of nanotechnology in biology would be to isolate one of these molecular motors from a living
system and then design and use it to construct a nanoscale product such
as a nanorobot to search out and destroy tumors in the human body.
Physics is the study of the most fundamental interactions between
energy and matter and time and space. Physics also includes quantum
mechanics, the study of matter and radiation at an atomic scale.
Much of modern technology, such as the transistor, and integrated
circuits, which are at the heart of modern computers and electronics, is
the result of physics research.
To study science and technology, one must have an adequate background in mathematics. Basic calculus is essential, and differential equations and linear algebra are widely used.

What Is Nanotechnology?

The field of engineering constitutes applied science or the use of
scientific principles to analyze and solve practical problems, and especially to design, build, operate, and maintain many types of constructions. The principle fields of engineering are civil and environmental, chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineering. But many other
specialized types of engineering exist. All types of engineering involve
the application of physics and mathematics to designing or problem
solving.
Feature: Mechanical Engineering

Physics is the foundation for all types of engineering. One of the
fields is mechanical engineering, a discipline that involves the application of principles of physics for analysis, design, manufacturing, and
maintenance of mechanical systems. Mechanical engineering requires
a solid understanding of key concepts including mechanics, kinematics,
thermodynamics, and energy.
Practitioners of mechanical engineering, known as mechanical engineers, use these principles and others in the design and analysis of automobiles, aircraft, heating and cooling systems, buildings and bridges,
industrial equipment and machinery, and more. At the scale of molecular technology, mechanical engineering develops molecular machines
and molecular machine components. See the Nano Interview at the end
of the chapter for more information about mechanical engineering and
its role in nanotechnology.
MAJOR NANOTECHNOLOGY CAREER AREAS

According to the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network,
opportunities for careers in these fields are expanding rapidly. A major
challenge for the field is the education and training of a new generation
of skilled workers.
Nanotechnology job projections are estimated to be nearly 2 million
workers worldwide by 2015. Most of the jobs will be in the United States,
Japan, and several European countries. In addition, nanotechnology
will create another 5 to 7 million jobs worldwide in support fields and
other industries.
The education levels of this workforce will include skilled workers
who have backgrounds in technical programs, have Associates degree
(2 years), Bachelors degree (4 years), Masters degree (6 years), and Doctorate (8 years). Note: Not everyone working in the field of nanotechnology will require a doctorate degree. The major career opportunities

However, the nanotechnology fields that will grow most rapidly in the
next decade will include:
r Medicine: diagnostics and therapeutics (e.g., drug delivery)
r Energy: fuel cells and batteries
r Robotics, many kinds

r Manufacturing: self-assembly
r Commerce: Radio Frequency Identification
r Space exploration

Richard Feynman (1918–1988)
Richard P. Feynman was an American physicist and one of the three
men who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. Feynman, who was
a long-term professor at California Institute of Technology, is best known
as one of the people who worked on atomic weapons at Los Alamos during World War II. He also discovered what caused the 1986 Challenger
explosion.
The idea of atom-by-atom construction was first put forth, in a scientific
manner, over 40 years ago by the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard
Feynman. In 1959, Feynman gave a lecture called “There’s Plenty of Room
at the Bottom.” In his speech, he predicted that an entire encyclopedia
would one day fit on the head of a pin and a library with all the world’s books

computers, atomic rearrangement, and nanomachines could float in veins.

Richard E. Smalley (1943–2005)
To many people, Richard Smalley was the foremost leader in nanotechnology. He has often been noted as the “Father of Nanotechnology.” Richard
Smalley was a Rice University
professor who won the NoDid you know?

the “Buckyballs”). Smalley was
hopeful that nanotechnology
could solve the global energy problem, which would ultimately solve other
worldwide problems such as hunger and water shortages. He believed the
potential for nanotechnology to benefit humanity was virtually limitless, and
he abided by the mantra: “Be a scientist; save the world.”
In 1999, the Rice University Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) was renamed the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale
Science and Technology in his honor.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY?

The long-term benefits of nanotechnology will lead to new means
of reducing the production of wastes, cycling industrial contamination,
providing potable water, and improving the efficiency of energy production and use. Good news for all. However, there are concerns that
the introduction of large quantities of nanostructured materials, such as
nanoparticles, into our everyday life may have ethical, legal, and societal
consequences.
Two independent studies released in 2003 included the risks of using
carbon nanotubes. Chiu-Wing Lam of NASA’s Johnson Space Center led
one of these studies and the other was led by David Warheit of Dupont.
Each study found that carbon nanotubes, when directly injected into
the lungs of mice, could damage lung tissue.
One overseas company that makes cleaning products using nanometer-scaled materials had to remove these products from stores because
several consumers were getting respiratory problems from using the
product.

NANOSAFE2

Several organizations are developing programs to make sure there is
a check and balance procedure to insure safety in the nanotechnology
field. One European organization consisting of members from seven European Union countries has formed an organization called NanoSafe2.
The overall aim of NANOSAFE2 is to develop risk assessment programs
and to establish ways to detect, track, and characterize nanoparticles.
These methods will be useful in determining any possible risks to humans and the environment. NANOSAFE2 will develop technologies to
cut down on exposure to nanoparticles and leaks to environment by
designing safe production equipment.
There are other organizations and associations engaged in nanotech
safety research. Some of these agencies include the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the National Toxicology Program of the Department
of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense (DOD), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy
(DOE), and the National Institutes of Health, the National Institutes
of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)

NIOSH is conducting research on nanotechnology and occupational
health. Its mission is to help answer questions that are critical for supporting the responsible development of nanotechnology.
Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications (NEHI)

The Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications
(NEHI) working group, composed of several U.S. government agencies,
has researched and reported on concerns about the safety of nanotechnology products. As of late 2006, one of the overriding concerns NEHI
identified was the difficulty and critical importance of reviewing the
safety of nanotechnology quickly enough to keep pace with the rapid
development and implementation of nanoproducts. Research and development, known as “R and D,” can occur very rapidly in the field
of nanotechnology, but the study of potential risks of new products to
health and the environment can take considerable time to reach conclusions and make decisions about product safety.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

In late 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded
about $4 million to fund a dozen research studies at universities on
possible risks associated with nanotechnology. See Chapter 8 for more
information about the Environmental Protection Agency.
Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN)

One of the aims of Rice University’s Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) is to characterize the unintended consequences of nanotechnology, particularly in the environmental arena.
As one of the six nanoscience and engineering centers funded by the
National Science Foundation, CBEN has a mandate to clear major roadblocks to nanotechnology commercialization. As the only center funded
under the National Nanotechnology Initiative that focuses exclusively on
environmental and biological systems, they are developing ways to use
nanotechnology to clean our environment and improve public health.
The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology

The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology has identified several
separate and severe risks. Some of their concerns are:
r Economic disruption from an abundance of cheap products.
r Economic oppression from artificially inflated prices.
r Personal risk from criminal or terrorist use.
r Personal or social risk from abusive restrictions.
r Social disruption from new products/lifestyles.

r Unstable arms race.
r Collective environmental damage from unregulated products.
r Free-range self-replicators (grey goo).
r Black market in nanotech.

Nanotechnology 101

What is mechanical engineering?
The classical definition of mechanical engineering is the discipline, the
science and technology that are required to create mechanical devices,
most often those that move themselves or other things. For instance,
mechanical engineers design and build mechanical systems that include
parts of airplanes, parts of automobiles, and even parts of satellites and
spacecraft.
My work, as a mechanical engineering researcher, is to generate the
knowledge that is required to build machines and their parts on a small
scale, that is, of a size that is approaching the molecular scale. I want
to be able to engineer these small-scale machines so that they may be
used to move other smaller parts around. For instance, we want to be
able to engineer nanomechanisms, nanoactuators and nanosensors; and
these machines will all depend upon some sort of nanoscale mechanical
device.
Most of mechanical engineering for the last 100 years or so, has dealt
with creating machines that were large enough so that we could handle
them with our hands. In the last 20 to 30 years engineers have started
building devices that are small enough so that one cannot use their
hands to handle or operate them, but yet the machines may still be observed via a magnifying glass. When we discuss mechanical engineering
in a nanotechnology context we are talking about building machines
out of individual atoms, individual molecules, or groups of molecules.
The machines I am working on are so small that one cannot see them
with a high-powered optical microscope.
There is a great deal of research that must be done before one can
engineer nanoscale machines. For instance, we need to understand
how to put them together. Once you’ve made them, how do you take
measurements so that you know if they are the right size? How do you
measure their motions so that you know if they are moving in the right
way? Then, after that, how do you take what you have made and turn it
into products that people would use in their everyday lives? As engineers,
we do these things with large-scale machines every day and we don’t
think twice about how to do them. We know how to do this from past
experience. At the nanoscale, we struggle to conceive of methods we
could use to do the same types of things.
What college did you go to? What was your major?
For my undergraduate studies, I received a scholarship to go to Iowa
State University. I was born in Iowa and lived there my entire childhood.
While attending Iowa State I worked at John Deere in the summer

What Is Nanotechnology?

and I worked in a research group on a project for NASA. From these
experiences I became interested in doing research on how to build new
machines that people had not been able to engineer before. At the time
I graduated from Iowa State, I was not interested in nanotechnology, as
it was not as well known then as it is today.
After I graduated, I applied to, and was accepted at, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) where I received a Master’s of Science degree and then a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. I am now an Associate
Professor and faculty member in Mechanical Engineering at MIT.
What interested you in seeking a career in mechanical engineering?
I became interested in mechanical systems and physics early on. While
attending high school, I had pulled apart an automobile carburetor
from my dad’s car. In those days, the automobile used a carburetor to
mix gasoline and air for the engine. Although I was not successful in
putting the pieces of the carburetor back together, I was fascinated by
the complexity of the parts in the carburetor and wondered how people
could design and make things that were so intricate.
Now as an Associate Professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I do research on building intricate,
small-scale machines out of atoms and molecules. This work requires an
understanding of mechanical engineering and the physics that govern
behavior at the molecular scale.
How did you get started in nanotechnology?
About 5 years ago, I was building machines at MIT that were macro-scale
in size. These machines were the size of a baseball or football. The macro
machines could move precisely and accurately enough so that they could
be a type of “construction equipment” for nanoscale machines. They
could interact with atoms and measure or help to make nanomachines.
Through making the larger machines, I gained knowledge of how one
could engineer smaller machines out of atoms and molecules. Now I am
designing, building, and testing nanoscale machines.
What is a nanomachine?
Nanoscale devices that can move and push upon other machines or
parts. Most biological systems, for instance you and I, are comprised of
billions of nanomachines. For instance, our muscle cells act in ways that
are similar to macro-scale machine behavior. Within our cells, molecules
perform a very intricate manipulation of atoms/other molecules that
help our cells replicate and/or heal. Even bacteria have nanoscale motors within them that they use to move around.

Nanotechnology 101

The nanomachines that I am interested in building are at an early
stage of development. When you look at them, they would resemble the
simplest type of machines that you would find at the large scale. For
instance, the simpler types of pieces that are put together to build a
more complex machine such as bolts, nuts, springs, and structural components. Something with a complex geometry, such as an automobile
engine or a robot, will take decades to build at the nanoscale.
There is ongoing work that aims to use carbon nanotubes (tubes that
are several atoms in diameter to hundreds of atoms in diameter) to make
small-scale machines. Researchers have discovered that these tubes may
be used to make bearings similar to those that enable a bicycle wheel
rotate. Bearings are one of the fundamental things that you need in
order to build machines that move and so engineers are trying to use
carbon nanotubes in this way. Scientists and engineers are just getting to
the point where they are starting to integrate these small-scale parts in
order to build simple nanoscale machines, such as a very small shifting
device on a bicycle. Most of these shifting devices rely primarily upon
the function of a mechanism, called a 4-bar linkage that shifts the chain
between sprockets. Building a shifting device at the nanoscale requires
5 to 10 years of research and trial and error. More complex nanoscale
machines, such as robotic grippers, will probably take 10 to 20 years or
more.
My group grows the carbon nanotubes and we use simulations to help
us understand how to use these tubes to engineer simple machines, for
instance the shifter as previously described.
What are some of the benefits of building nanomachines?
Speed and cost are two major benefits of nanomachines. With respect to
speed, there are physical laws that govern the speed at which machines
may move as a consequence of their mass and stiffness, both of which
are usually related to their size. In most cases, the smaller the machine,
the faster the machine can be run. If you can build mechanical devices
that can run at millions of motions per second, they might be used to
accomplish many tasks in a short time. With respect to cost, it becomes
inexpensive to build a nanomachine if one uses the right nanomanufacturing processes, because thousands or millions of machines may be
made simultaneously.
It is likely that future nanomachines will have an impact on many
devices including computers, sensors, and electromechanical devices. It
is hoped that nanomachines will increase the speed of store-bought
conventional products by a factor of 100 to 1,000. The costs for

What Is Nanotechnology?

these new products would also be less than the cost of conventional
products.
In addition, smaller machine elements that are made of carbon nanotubes could be used as energy sources for products. The special properties of the nanotubes will allow engineers to build better batteries that
have huge energy densities. These batteries may be able to power automobiles, and possibly provide longer-lived portable power sources, for
example in an iPod.
Are there any environmental issues or risks in building nanomachines?
One of the things that people should keep in mind is that nanoparticles
are small compared to a human cell, roughly 10 – 1000 times smaller.
It has been proposed, and I stress the word proposed, that certain types
of nanoparticles might be get into cells and do harmful things. I am
not an expert in the biology, chemistry or toxicology but I know of
experts in these fields that have researched particles to see if they are
harmful. In my laboratory, we treat nanoparticles as though they are
harmful even though a lot of the evidence shows that they are not. For
instance, most people do not know that many cosmetics use certain
types of nanoparticles and they have been used for many years without
adverse effects.
You mentioned in an article, that potential young scientists needed to
learn the language of mathematics. You stated that mathematics is the
language of logical thought. Could you expand on that comment?
What I was trying to say is that mathematical expressions are a way to
express a logical idea. Many students forget this and then in their eyes,
math becomes something abstract that has little use in everyday life.
They don’t realize that when one thinks about problems, as an engineer
or everyday life, they use logic to solve those problems. An engineer or
scientist needs to be able to convert common sense and logical ideas
in a concise and universally understood form. Mathematics allows us to
do this and this helps us to solve engineering and everyday problems.
Knowing math is a powerful tool.
What other advice would you give young people who would like
a career in mechanical engineering?
My advice is to find somebody who has the same interests that you have,
and who seeks excellence in all that they do. Choose someone who can
pass those interests on to you and teach you the skills/discipline/fun
of doing things well. My parents and grandparents filled these roles for
me. They were passionate about the idea of “if you were going to do

something, then do it right.” My grandfathers had a passion for working
on mechanical things and those skills they had were like magic to me.
I wanted to learn to do what they could do. They also did an excellent
job and by observing their habit of excellence, I came to expect a lot
from myself whenever I do something. Young people should also find
a mentor that can pass on to them an understanding of why things are
important and why they are relevant to everyday life. At the same time,
make sure you have fun doing what interests you. For instance, if you love
music or acting, you can learn mechanical engineering and/or physics
and then apply them to make better instruments or devices for sets. The
same thing applies to people that love cars, robots, airplanes, medicine,
woodworking, and sports. You can use mechanical engineering, math,
and physics to make useful contributions in these areas and have great
fun at the same time.
Would you want any of our readers (teachers/students) to contact you
at your lab or by e-mail?
My lab’s Web site is http://pcsl.mit.edu
E-mail (culpepper@mit.edu) is OK, but I can’t guarantee a response
due to the fact that I receive about 100–200 non-spam e-mails per day
that I have to respond to.

The Science of
Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is having the ability and the knowledge to manufacture
products at the nanoscale—one billionth of a meter. All materials that
are one-billionth of a meter are invisible to the human eye. The naked
eye can see to about 20 microns. A micron (10−6 ) is one-millionth of a
meter. Even using an optical microscope that uses light energy, we can
only see materials that are about 1 micron in size.
In Chapter 1 you read about a number of nanotechnology products that are sold today. These products included pants that are stainresistant, sunscreens that protect the skin against sun rays, medical dressings that are used for burn victims and special nanoparticles used to
make tennis rackets and hockey sticks. So, how can you “see,” manipulate, and make products at the nanometer scale, the size of atoms and
molecules?
To understand how nanotechnology can be used to manufacture these
nanoproducts, you need to review the science of:
r matter and its forms,
r matter’s smallest particles—atoms and molecules,
r chemical bonding of atoms and molecules,
r molecular self-assembly, and

r how to manipulate matter at a scale of 1 to 100 nanometers.
WHAT IS MATTER?
Forms of Matter

Look around you. Everything around you is made up of matter. Matter
is the air you breathe, the water you drink, the food you eat, the clothes
you wear, and the home you live in.

Matter is anything that has mass and volume. Mass is the amount of
matter in an object and volume is the amount of space occupied by an
object. Matter exists in three principal forms, called phases—gas, liquid,
and solid.
Gas, or vapor, is the most energetic phase of matter. In gases, the
particles (individual atoms or molecules) are far apart from each other
and can move about freely. Air neither holds its shape nor its volume
because particles move freely through open space. As a result, gases
expand to fill the shape of their container. A gas, such as oxygen, is
in constant motion and takes the shape of and completely fills any
container holding it.
In liquids, the particles are much closer together. So liquids are far
more difficult to compress. The particles that make up liquids move
about, enabling liquids to change shape easily. A liquid takes the shape
of the container holding it.
In solids, the forces between the particles are strong enough to hold
the particles together in specific positions causing solids to maintain
their shape. As an example, copper holds it shape

properties of a substance include color, odor, hardness, density, and the
ability to conduct electricity and heat. We distinguish different types of
matter by the differences in such physical properties. As an example,
the formation of ice is a physical phase change, freezing of water. Each
substance has unique phase change properties, such as the temperatures, at which freezing or boiling of the substance occurs, known as the
“freezing point” and “boiling point.”
Chemical properties describe the ability of a substance to change from
one kind of substance into a new and different brand-new substance.
The formation of iron oxide (rust) is a chemical change. The more
properties you can identify in a gas, liquid, or solid, the better you know
the nature of that substance.
PROPERTIES OF MATTER CHANGE AT THE NANOSCALE

The properties of matter depend in part on size. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of matter generally differ at the nanoscale
when compared to the larger quantities of the same material. This is
due, in part, to the difference in surface area per unit of volume at the
nanoscale.
Suppose we have a cube of salt. Its volume area is length times height
times depth. Let’s say that the block is 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm, which
is 1 cubic millimeter altogether. (We’re using millimeters (mm) instead
of nanometers for simplicity.)
The cube has 6 square sides, each of which is (1 mm × 1 mm) 1 square
mm in area, so the whole cube has an area of 6 square mm. The ratio of
the area (A) of the cube to the volume (V) of the cube is A divided by
V (written “A/V”) or a ratio of 6/1. Now, in contrast, suppose we have
a bigger cube of salt whose edges are 2 mm long instead of 1 mm, so
this cube has a volume (2 × 2 × 2) of 8 cubic mm. The area of each
side of this salt cube is 2 mm × 2 mm, or 4 square mm, and the area
of the cube’s entire surface then is 6 × 4 square mm, or 24 square mm.
So the area-to-volume ratio of the big block is 24 divided by 8, which
equals an A/V ratio of 3/1. So, the bigger cube has a smaller A/V ratio
than the smaller cube. This example demonstrates how smaller cubes
will have greater ratios of surface area to volume. Table 2.2 summarizes
this principle.
This table illustrates how as the sides of a cube get shorter, the volume
of a cube gets smaller more quickly than its surface area, so the ratio
A/V increases. The ratio A/V is twice as great for the cube of 1 mm as
for the cube of 2 mm, and three times as great as the cube of 3 mm. This
phenomenon happens on the nanoscale very significantly.

Notice how the ratio of area to volume changes as the cube becomes smaller.

For a given substance, increasing the number of nanoscale particles
also increases the proportion of atoms on the surface compared with the
number of internal atoms. Atoms at the surface often behave differently
from those located in the interior. Atoms at the surface have a higher
energy state, which means they are more likely to react with particles
of neighboring substances. The result is that chemical reactions can
take place between atoms and molecules at surfaces acting as miniature
chemical reactors.
By modifying materials at the nanoscale other properties such as
magnetism, hardness, and electrical and heat conductivity can be
changed substantially. These changes arise from confining electrons
in nanometer-sized structures. As one example, electrons (subatomic
particles) do not flow in streams as they do in ordinary electrical wires.
At the nanoscale, electrons act like waves. When electrons act as waves,
they can pass through insulation that blocks flowing electrons.
Another example of changes at the nanoscale is that some nano substances that should not dissolve in a liquid actually do dissolve. Some
elements like gold also show change at the nanoscale. At the macro scale,
gold metal is shiny yellow as you noticed in jewelry. If you break up the
gold, to particle 100 nanometers wide, it still looks shiny yellow. But,
when you break down the particle of gold to 30 nanometers across, the
gold appears bright red. As the particle of gold gets even smaller than
30 nanometers, it looks purple and when it is a little bit smaller it will
appear brownish in color. Color can change in some other substances,
like gold, at the nanoscale. Physical properties including strength, crystal shape, solubility, thermal and electrical conductivity, and magnetic
and electronic properties also change as the size decreases.
Let’s look at another example of how a physical property changes
at the nanometer scale. At the macro scale, a sheet of aluminum is
harmless. However, when the particles of aluminum are cut down in size
to 20 to 30 nanometers, the metal can explode.

area also allows a fast reaction with less time. Therefore, many properties can be altered at the nanoscale. That’s the power of nanotechnology.
MATTER’S SMALLEST PARTICLES: MATTER IS MADE UP
OF ELEMENTS

Nanotechnology’s raw materials are the chemical elements. Any sample of matter, whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid, is either an element
or is composed of several elements. Elements are known as the building
blocks of matter. An element consists purely of atoms of one kind. It is
a substance composed of pure chemicals that cannot be separated into
simpler substances. Therefore, an element is always an element, even at
the nanoscale.
Sulfur, copper, carbon, oxygen, iron are some common examples
of pure chemical elements. Just four of these—carbon (C), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N)—make up approximately
96 percent of the human body. Much of Earth, including the universe, consists of several elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen that are found in our bodies, too. Other common elements include iron, copper, calcium, nickel, potassium, and
mercury. Many of these elements are listed on the side of vitamin
bottles.
The Periodic Table of Elements

The chemical elements are arranged in a chart called the Periodic
Table of Elements. The table of elements represents the building blocks
of everything—both living and nonliving. About 90 elements have been
identified as occurring naturally on Earth. The Periodic Table of Elements is an important tool for scientists.
The table helps them understand the physical and chemical properties of individual elements.

The Periodic Table can be divided into three basic groups of elements.
The groups include metals, nonmetals, and semimetals or metalloids.
Semi-metals have the properties of both metals and nonmetals. Chemists
use one or two letter symbols to represent elements. As an example, the
symbol for aluminum is Al. The symbol for oxygen is O.
r The metal elements make up the majority of the groups of elements—
more than 70 percent. Some of these metals include potassium, calcium,
sodium, barium, and the more familiar ones include such metals as tin,
lead, aluminum, copper, mercury, silver, and gold. Mercury is the only
metallic element that is liquid at room temperature. Gold and silver
nanoparticles are used in medical research and for treating burns and
wounds and in cancer research. Most metals are good conductors of electricity and heat and are malleable—easy to bend and shape. However,
electrical conductivity in metal decreases with increasing temperature,
whereas in semiconductors, electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature.
r Some of the nonmetals include chlorine, bromine, iodine, and fluorine.
The nonmetals are dull in color, usually brittle, and are poor conductors of
electricity and heat. You are not going to find too many of these elements
in nanofabrication.
r A few elements are classified as metalloids or semimetals because they
are between a metal and a nonmetal. The metalloids include silicon (S),
boron (B), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), and tin (Sn). Metalloids have
properties of both metals and nonmetals.

Some of the metalloids, such as silicon and germanium, are used as
semiconductors in transistors. Transistors are the fundamental building
blocks of a microchip and are built on a silicon base.
Semiconductors

A semiconductor is a common term used in the electronics and the
computer field. Semiconductors are generally made from certain elements such as silicon, germanium, and chemical compounds such as
lead sulfide.
Semiconductors have a special atomic structure that allows their conductivity properties (both good and not so good) to be controlled by energy from electric currents, electromagnetic fields, or even light sources.
As an example, when you apply heat energy to a semiconductor you can
increase its conductivity of electricity. These semiconductor properties
make it possible to use them to make products such as transistors, integrated circuits, and many other types of electronic devices.

SMALLEST PART OF AN ELEMENT: THE ATOM

The smallest quantity of an element, which has all of the properties
of the element, is an atom. An atom is a microscopic structure found in
all ordinary matter around us.
Atoms are extremely small, on the order of one to several nanometers
wide. A nanoparticle would be a collection of tens to thousands of atoms
measuring about 1 to 100 nanometers in diameter. As an example, it
would take more than a million atoms to match the thickness of this

INSIDE THE ATOM: SUBATOMIC PARTICLES

The three basic kinds of subparticles that make up the atom consist
of neutrons, protons, and electrons.
Neutrons and Protons

Almost all the mass of an atom is in the nucleus. The nucleus lies at the
center of the atom. The nucleus consists of two types of particles, protons
and neutrons. These two particles are called nucleons, the building
blocks of the atomic nuclei.
The protons have a positive electric charge. Neutrons do not have
any electric charge; therefore they are an electrically neutral subatomic
particles of the nucleus. The strong nuclear force binds protons and
neutrons together to make the nucleus.
Electrons

Electrons exist outside the nucleus. Electrons carry a negative charge,
equal in magnitude and opposite to the charge of a proton. An electron
is 1/1836 the mass of a proton and is much smaller. Electrons carry electrical current and the manipulation of these electrons allows electronic

devices to function. The electron is a subatomic particle that carries an
electric charge. When electrons are in motion, they produce an electric
current and a magnetic field. Since the nucleus (protons and neutrons)
and electrons have opposite charges, electrical forces hold the atom
together.
Isotopes

Isotopes of a particular element have the same number of protons, but
have a different number of neutrons. If you could change the number
of neutrons an atom has, you could make an isotope of that element.
MODELS OF THE ATOMS

Scientists use models to describe and represent the atom. There are
several models of the atom to form a concrete or mental picture of
what an atom looks like. One model developed by Niels Bohr in 1913
illustrates the atom as having a central nucleus with electrons orbiting

around it. In the 1920s scientists improved on the model of the atom.
One theory is that the electrons move about in a cloud-like region
surrounding the nucleus. The electron cloud represents some probable
locations of where the electrons are likely to be at a set time.
These models should not be interpreted as any visual representation
of an atomic model or as a recreation of an actual atom. The best models
are those that are purely mathematical. However, the atomic model
images do help as a guide in understanding concepts in chemistry and
other sciences.
Early Atomic Theory by Empedocles and Democritus

Empedocles was a Greek philosopher and scientist who lived in Sicily
between 492 B.C. and 432 B.C. One of his theories was to describe things
around us. Empedocles proposed that all matter was composed of four
elements: fire, air, water, and Earth. As an example, stone was believed to
contain a higher amount of Earth than the other elements. The rabbit
was believed to contain a higher amount of both water and fire than the
other two elements.

Another Greek philosopher, Democritus, who lived from 460 B.C.
to 370 B.C., developed another theory of matter. He believed that all
matter was made of tiny parts. He demonstrated his idea by stating if
someone continued to cut an object into smaller and smaller pieces, you
would reach the point where the piece was so tiny that it could no longer
be cut up and divided. Democritus called these small pieces of matter
atomos, meaning “indivisible.” He suggested that atomos, or atoms, were
eternal and could not be destroyed. During his time, Democritus did
not have the means that could prove or disprove his theory or even
test it.
Atomic Number and Atomic Mass

The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines an
element’s atomic number. In other words, each element has a unique
number that identifies how many protons are in one atom of that element. For example, all hydrogen atoms, and only hydrogen atoms,
contain one proton and have an atomic number of 1. All carbon atoms,
and only carbon atoms, contain six protons and have an atomic number
of 6. Oxygen atoms contain 8 protons and have an atomic number of 8.
The atomic number of an element never changes.
Atomic masses of elements, however, depend on the number of neutrons as well as protons in an atom and differ from their atomic numbers.
Atomic mass is indicated in the periodic table of elements as Atomic Mass
Units (AMU) and is a larger value than the atomic number.
ATOMS AND MOLECULES

Nanotechnology is all about the manipulation of atoms and
molecules. Atoms seldom exist in a solitary state. Occasionally, atoms
join together with their own
kind of element. Sometimes,
You may want to see the video, NanoManithe atom joins together with
pulator: Seeing and Touching Molecules. http://
www.nanotech-now.com/multimedia.htm
other elements. When an
atom of one element chemically combines with an atom of another kind of element, they form a
compound. For example, water (H2 0) is a compound made from two
elements, hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). The smallest part of the compound is a molecule, a combination of two or more atoms.
Molecules range in size from a few atoms to thousands of atoms. How
do atoms join together to form molecules?

MOLECULES AND CHEMICAL BONDING

Knowing how molecules bond together is important in understanding
how nanostructures can be manufactured.
Molecules are combinations of atoms held together by chemical
bonds. A chemical bond is actually an electrostatic force between electrons and protons and between atoms and molecules. One research
article stated the electrostatic force is quite strong. Electrostatic forces
are more than 1000 times as strong as gravitational forces. The chemical
and physical properties of matter result from the ability of atoms to form
bonds from electrostatic forces. There are two main types of chemical
bonds that hold those atoms together. They are called ionic bonds and
covalent bonds.
Ionic Bonding

Atoms can lose or gain electrons forming an ion, which has a net
electric charge. A negative charged ion, called an anion (pronounced
/AN-ion/), is formed when an atom or a special group of atoms gains
additional electrons. When an atom loses some electrons, a positive
charged ion is created called a cation (pronounced CAT-ion).
Ionic bonding takes place between two oppositely charged ions, an
anion and a cation. Ions may consist of a single atom or multiple atoms,
in which a group of atoms is called a “polyatomic ion.” Examples of
polyatomic anions include: carbonate ion, which is composed of carbon
and oxygen; and sulfate ion, which is composed of sulfur and oxygen.
An example of a polyatomic cation is ammonium ion, which consists of
nitrogen and hydrogen. Cations are usually metal atoms and anions are
either nonmetals or polyatomic ions (ions with more than one atom).
The attraction of the two charges holds the atoms or molecules together.
Electrostatic forces hold ionic bonds together. Many compounds made
up of an anion and cation will dissolve in water, so that the two ions
separate in the water and make an ionic solution. Ionic solutions are
used for treating and cleaning the eye.
Ionic bonding occurs between an element that is a metal and one that
is a nonmetal. The majority of geological materials, such as minerals and
rocks, feature ionic bonding, predominantly.
Covalent Bonds and Monomers

Covalent chemical bonds are different from ionic bonding. Covalent
bonding involves the sharing of a pair of electrons by two atoms. A

molecule of water, written H2 0, is held together by covalent bonds. The
two elements, hydrogen and oxygen, share electrons.
Covalent bonding occurs between two elements that are nonmetals.
Much of the matter of substances in your everyday life, the solids, liquids,
and gases, are the results of covalent bonding. Covalent bonds occur
in all sorts of organic substances, including materials associated with
living things, such as plant or animal tissue, food, and the like. Covalent
bonding predominates in biological systems, although ions have very
important roles in these systems, too.
A Monomer

A small molecule that is held together by covalent bonding is called
a monomer (from Greek mono “one” and meros “part”). Examples of
monomers are hydrocarbons that consist only of the elements carbon
(C) and hydrogen (H). Hydrocarbons are combustible when they combine with oxygen. They are the main components of fossil fuels, which
include petroleum, coal, and natural gas. When the covalent bonds of
these types of substances are broken they will release energy, which is
what occurs when fossil fuels burn.
From Monomers to Polymers

Monomers may become chemically bonded to several other similar
monomers to form a polymer. A polymer is a term used to describe a
very long molecule consisting of structural units and repeating units
connected by covalent chemical bonds. When monomers are linked
together to each other during a chemical reaction, it is called polymerization. Often polymerization occurs as a chain reaction, which will
continue until a large number of the monomers have combined (polymerized) with each other. The result of polymerization is a chain or
other network of linked monomers that can be formed into fibers,
sheets, fabrics, foams, or other structures, depending on the type of
polymer.
Polymers can occur naturally, mainly in living organisms, or synthetically, through manufacturing. A few general examples of naturally occurring polymers include proteins, starches, and cellulose. Starches are
polymers composed of sugars. Latex, from the sap of rubber trees, can
be made to polymerize into latex rubber. The genetic materials DNA and
RNA found in chromosomes and cells are also types of polymers. Several
natural fibers such as wool, silk, and spider web thread are polymers.
Scientists and engineers study the formation, structure, and properties
of such natural polymers as models for synthetic nanomaterials.

everyday life. Some familiar
examples of polymers include the common plastics, polystyrene, and
polyethylene. These kinds of polymers are used in everything from
food containers and packaging materials to cars, boats, and computers. Polyvinyl alcohol is a main ingredient in latex paints, hair sprays,
shampoos, and glues, and waxes and oils. Let’s look at some examples
of applications of polymerization in nanotechnology.
Polymer-Based Nanosponges

At the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico,
scientists have developed a reusable polymer-based nanosponge. The
nanosponge has nanometer-sized pores that can absorb and trap organic contaminants in water. The Nanosponge polymer can be used
to clean up organic explosives and oil or organic chemical spills especially in water, while decreasing clean up costs associated with present
technologies. The nanosponge is made up of polymeric building blocks
that form cylindrical cages to trap organics. After the sponges are saturated with contaminants, they can be rinsed with ethanol to remove the
contaminants and the nanosponge can then be reused.
The polymer sponge has multiple applications. For example, a polymer designed as a membrane can be placed on a water faucet. The
membrane can be used to treat and purify the water for drinking and
cooking uses. One advantage of using polymers is that they are inexpensive to manufacture and can be used in a variety of water treatment
systems.

Polymer Solar Cells

In the hope of making solar energy more useful and affordable, several scientists have been working on creating organic photovoltaic cells.
Their goal is to replace the usual silicon (S) with readily available materials such as carbon (C). If they succeed, designers could one day
integrate solar cells into everyday gadgets like iPods and cell phones.
Even the energy absorbed by window tinting could be used to power a
laptop, for example.
One team of researchers at the University of California have developed an organic photovoltaic cell that uses a polymer, or plastic, material
in a unique way. Like other organic solar cells, the plastic material in
their prototype includes a polymer material. The material, composed of
common chemicals, is sandwiched between conductive electrodes. Photons in the sunlight “knock” electrons from the polymer onto one of
the electrodes. This causes an electrical imbalance where one electrode
becomes positively charged while the other is negatively charged. When
this happens an electrical current is created. See Chapter 8 for more
information about solar cells.

dendrimers have been synthesized. They can be very useful in low-cost plastics such as radiator
hoses, weather stripping, and gasket seals. In biotechnology applications, dendrimers are useful for their antiviral properties.
Dendrimers and Drug Delivery

Nanotechnology has the potential to be very useful for improving drug
delivery in treating patients with illnesses and diseases. The delivery of
drugs into the body cannot be a hit or miss effort. The drug molecules
have to find the exact place in the body where they can be the most
effective. An anticancer drug needs to be delivered to a tumor where it
can do the most good. You do not want the anticancer drug delivered
to another organ in the body.

Dendrimers have several advantages in drug delivery; Dendrimers
can hold a drug’s molecules in their structure and deliver the drug to
a particular part of the body such as a tumor. Dendrimers can enter
cells easily and release drugs on target and don’t trigger immune system
responses.
Dendrimers can also be used for chemical analysis and diagnosis of
the human body and to locate, diagnose, and then treat tumors or other
sick cells. However, more research in safety issues needs to be done.

MOLECULAR SELF-ASSEMBLY AND NANOFABRICATION

The term used for the manufacturing of nanoproducts and nanostructures is nanofabrication. One branch of nanofabrication is self-assembly.
Self-assembly is a strategy in which objects and devices, such as atoms
and molecules, can arrange themselves into an orderly structure or final
product without any outside assistance. Self-assembly could occur if you
could shake a box of separated puzzle pieces, then look inside the box
to see a finished puzzle. The puzzle pieces self-assembled. Materials that
self-assemble include snowflakes, salt crystals, and soap bubbles. Each
one arranges itself into a pattern.
In the human body, the self-assembly process is similar to the way your
bones grow. Individual molecules are formed layer by layer on a surface
of the bone. Self-assembly occurs spontaneously when the human body
converts food, water, and air into a variety of acids, sugars, and minerals.
From these materials cells, blood, tissues, and muscles are created. All
of these biological functions are due to the self-assembly of molecules
in the human body which continue to build and repair cells and store
energy all day long.
What is the advantage of using self-assembling in nanofabrication?
One major reason is that to design and assemble nanoparticles atom by
atom to make a lot of products is too slow and costly. Also, the atoms
are too small for anyone to direct, find, and place individually and
quickly.

Self-Assembly. Many researchers are exploring self-assembly of molecules at
the nanoscale to produce structures. In this activity, middle school students
R
are modeling how self-assembly takes place. In this activity several LEGO
blocks are placed peg-side down on water. In time, the bricks will interact
with the surface tension of the water and with each other to assemble into
a pattern. (Courtesy Dean Campbell)

SOAP BUBBLES SELF-ASSEMBLE

Soap molecules can self-assemble into bubbles when you blow air
through a soapy loop. The soap bubble molecules form two layers that
contain a layer of water in between. The soap forms a monolayer on
the inside and a monolayer on the outside of the water. Each layer of
soap is a self-assembled monolayer. The distance between the outer and
inner layers of the bubble is about 150 nanometers. But the soap layer
can become a bubble only when the conditions are just right. You need
mostly air and very little water.
USING THE SELF-ASSEMBLY STRATEGY TO MAKE PRODUCTS

About one-quarter of the 2,000 or so nanotechnology projects the National Science Foundation now sponsors involve molecular self-assembly.

Nanotechnology 101

Molecular self-assembly is the most important of the nanoscale fabrication techniques because it’s fast, inexpensive, and produces less waste.
Some of the major companies investing heavily in self-assembly include Merck, Pfizer, 3M, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard. About one-quarter
of the 2,000 or so nanotechnology projects the National Science Foundation now sponsors involve self-assembly.
Many soft or fluid consumer products such as foods, paints, detergents, personal care products, and cosmetics contain nanometer structures that are formed by the self-assembly of molecules.
OTHER APPLICATIONS OF MOLECULAR SELF-ASSEMBLY
Self-Assembly in Medicine

Using the self-assembly process in medicine applications could greatly
improve orthopedic implants. The average life of an implant today is
about 15 years, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons. When implants fail in the body, they often break or crack the
bone they are attached to. It is also very difficult to get bone to grow on
the implant, which is usually made of titanium or ceramics.
Researchers have developed a special coating comprising molecules
that self-assemble into a structure similar to that of bone. The research
shows that when such a coating is applied to an implant, bone cells adapt
to these structures and grow onto them.
In another research project, scientists have designed artificial
molecules that self-assemble to form structures that they think could be
used to create a piece of artificial spinal cord. The artificial spinal cord
could help paralyzed patients regain some mobility. The self-assembled
molecule structures would act as a scaffold in which spinal-cord tissue
or bone tissue could regenerate.
Self-assembly could change the nature of drug making too. A research group in Rochester, New York, is working on molecules that can
self-assemble into drugs. The drugs would have the potential to sense
cells with a disease and target them with treatments. The self-assembled
molecules bind to specific genes that cause certain genetic diseases and
this process blocks the genes from functioning. Of course, self-assembly
in drug making still has to be proven nontoxic to humans. Human
clinical trials are necessary. There is also the lengthy federal approval
process to go through. Plus, scientists have yet to learn how to design
the right molecules and figure out how to force them to assemble in
certain ways.

The Science of Nanotechnology

NanoSonic, Inc.

Several companies use molecular self-assembly to make products. One
of the companies, NanoSonic Inc., is located in Blacksburg, Virginia,
The company’s team of researchers is headed by the president, Dr.
Richard Claus, a professor at Virginia Tech. NanoSonic Inc. makes a
patented material called Metal RubberTM using a molecular layering
process, known as electrostatic self-assembly.
Metal RubberTM looks like brown plastic wrap, and has some amazing
properties, including elasticity. “We can stretch it to about 200 to 300
percent of its original length, and it relaxes back,” says Dr. Claus. “It’s
very tough. We can expose it to chemicals. We can put it in jet fuel. We
can hit it with acetone. We can boil it in water overnight, and it doesn’t
mechanically or chemically degrade. We can heat it up to about . . . 700
Fahrenheit. It won’t burn. We can drop it down to about . . . minus 167
degrees Fahrenheit, and it maintains its properties.”
To make Metal RubberTM , the scientists at Nanosonic built it molecule
by molecule. The nanotechnology process that is used is called electrostatic molecular self-assembly. “The Metal RubberTM virtually assembles
itself,” says Dr. Claus.
The scientists start with a plastic or glass substrate, or base, that they
have given an electric charge, either positive or negative. Then they
dip the substrate alternately into two water-based solutions. One solution contains ionic molecules that have been given a positive electrical charge (cations). The other solution contains ionic molecules
that have a negative charge. If the substrate has a positive charge,
it goes into the negative molecules first. The molecules cling to
the substrate, forming a layer only one molecule thick. After the
next dipping, into positive molecules, a second ultrathin layer forms.
Making Metal RubberTM , Dr. Claus explains, is like “making a layer
cake.”
Dr. Claus says that with Metal RubberTM , nanotechnology has produced a material with many potential uses. One of the most exciting is
to make what he calls “morphing aircraft structures. These are aircraft
that dynamically change the shape of their wings and their control surfaces during flight,” he explains. “Almost the way that a hawk might fly
along, see prey, and change its shape to dive down. For a plane, you
need a material that’s mechanically flexible. But you also need a material with a surface that’s controlled by sensors and electrical conductors
that allow it to do that sensing and change shape accordingly.”

NANO INTERVIEW: DR. RICHARD CLAUS, PRESIDENT
OF NANOSONIC

Dr. Richard Claus is president of NanoSonic, Inc., located in
Blacksburg, Virginia. Dr. Claus responded to questions from students
at the ForwardVIEW Academy in North Kingstown, Rhode Island.
The students under the guidance of their chemistry teacher, Ms.
Catherine Marcotte, were involved in doing many of the activities in
the NanoSonic Kit. The following are questions that they addressed to
Dr. Claus.
What made you (Dr. Claus) want to study nanotech?
I was teaching engineering at Virginia Tech and one of the students in
my group started a small project in the lab. That was in the early 1990s,
and I have been interested ever since.
What college did you go to?
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
What was your major?
As an undergraduate, I majored in Arts and Sciences. As a graduate
student, I majored in Engineering.
How did you get started in Nanotechnology?
I was working on the faculty at Virginia Tech and doing work with
a number of students in the area of optical fibers. We had a project
with a company to put magnetic coatings onto a fiber, and the student mentioned above tried a “nanotechnology” process to apply the
coating.
When did you get your first idea about starting NanoSonic?
Again, I was teaching at Virginia Tech, and another company came to
us and asked us to do a project with them. The university could not
approve the legal terms and conditions of the contract proposed by the
company, so we went off campus and started our own company to do
the work. Our objective was really just to support a graduate student and
not to start a company.
Who comes up with all the NanoSonic ideas?
We all do. We currently have 62 people at NanoSonic, and they are a very
interesting mix of individuals with very different technical backgrounds
and experiences. Most of our ideas are due to the combination of suggestions from our chemists and engineers and production people. One

of our key laboratory staff people has a background and education in
art, and we depend on her extensively for suggestions.
Does nanotechnology have any impact on your life?
Directly, no. But there are lots of parts of my life that relate to nanotechnology that seem more fun now, like why the sky is blue (really) and how
I can prevent the inside of my car windows from fogging.
What is the best thing you have ever done involving nanotechnology?
The best thing I have ever done has been hiring good people who know
a lot more about many different aspects of nanotechnology and practical
manufacturing than I do. They are the ones who do all of the work.
Has studying this field changed the way you look at some things?
Yes, as I mentioned earlier. One example is that nanoparticles are in a
number of normal household products, like suntan lotion. A few months
ago, a group of us went to the local drugstore and spent about an hour
looking at ingredients on the backs of suntan lotion products.
How did you start the company?
When Virginia Tech did not want to pursue the project with the company
I mentioned above, we started the company the following afternoon
online using a credit card. It took about 15 minutes.
Is your job fun?
Yes, very much.
Can you cut Metal RubberTM ?
Yes, with a pair of scissors or a knife. It has the consistency of a mouse
pad.
Could you send a small sample of Metal RubberTM to our school?
Let me see if the people down in the production area have anything we
can send.
Could you visit our school?
I would be glad to if I am up your way.
What led to your making Metal RubberTM ?
Several of us went to a large international conference and heard a talk
by a professor at a major research university. He said that no one would
ever make anything big and thick using self-assembly processing. The
person next to me, Dr. Jennifer Lalli, turned to me and whispered, “We
can do that!” Within a few weeks, Dr. Lalli and her group had made our
first Metal RubberTM materials.

Are you taking the measures to protect the environment from the
pollution of the process (is there any?) of making Metal RubberTM
because it will stop a lot of problems in the future?
Yes, we are. The byproducts of the production process are not significant
pollutants, but we work closely with our town to properly handle and
treat all of the materials that we generate.
Where would you dispose of Metal RubberTM ?
In a landfill most probably. Again, it is pretty much like a mousepad.
Is it environmentally safe and biodegradable?
Safe, yes. Biodegradable, no. It is something like milk jug containers—
they are safe but will not degrade in a landfill for a long time.
Can you recycle it into something else?
Yes, we can. I was on the phone about this in particular about an hour
ago.
How did you hear about nanotech?
Meetings and conferences mostly, and technical journals. I was a professor at Virginia Tech for about 30 years, so I did a lot of reading about
science and engineering. I still do.
NANO ACTIVITY: NANOTECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION KIT
FROM NANOSONIC

You can learn more about self-assembly by doing some of the experiments in a nanotechnology school kit produced by Dr. Claus and
the scientists at NanoSonic Inc. The Nanotechnology Demonstration
kit provides experiments that are designed for middle and high school
science classes. The kit contains all of the materials you need for 24
students. Instructions, worksheets, teacher aids, and a resource CD are
provided.
The purpose of the Nanotechnology Demonstration Kit is to allow
secondary school students to learn about nanotechnology and next
generation materials by making and testing nanostructured materials
by themselves using a minimum of laboratory supplies and ordinary tap
water.
The kit is divided into five units that will introduce students to the
following concepts.

Ms. Catherine Marcotte, a science teacher and her high school classes,
had the opportunity to use the Nanotechnology Demonstration Kit of
activities produced by Professor Richard Claus of NanoSonic, Inc, and
the manufacturer of Metal RubberTM . Her class interviewed Dr. Richard
Claus and asked him questions about his work. I asked Ms. Marcotte
to comment on her experiences as a science teacher and her thoughts
about the world at the nanoscale. Here are her comments.
“I am currently in my eleventh year teaching varied science topics to
small, mixed groups of secondary school students at an alternative public school program called ForwardVIEW Academy in North Kingstown,
Rhode Island.
“Most often, each spring or summer, a science theme, such as energy,
water, or science, society, and technology as in this year, seems to be in
the air that becomes the core of my plans for the coming school year.
Other times, the course is chosen and serendipity works its magic. Basic
chemistry was the focus that year and, coincidentally, nanotechnology
seemed to be on the cover of every magazine.
“Then, I had the pleasure to meet the author Mr. John Mongillo,
who brought everything together with a lab kit for high school science
involving nanotechnology by NanoSonic, Inc., which he wanted to coteach with me in my classes. I was thrilled. It fit in perfectly and also
provided the perfect segue to this year’s technology theme.
“The kit gave students the opportunity to apply the concepts of nanotechnology, such as self-assembly, in making a film on a glass slide one
molecule layer at a time! In the unit, students were reminded of atomic
structure and learned of electrostatics, and were also made aware of the
many careers available in the growing field of nanotechnology.
“Later, through John, the students and I had a rewarding conversation with the President of NanoSonic, Inc., Dr. Richard Claus, by writing
questions for Dr. Claus to which he kindly responded by email. The
entire experience brought the classes’ imaginations far beyond the confines of the classroom, from the uses for flexible Metal RubberTM to even
a lovely house in the misty, morning hills of Blacksburg, Virginia, and
the thoughtful musings of a scientist and company president in answer
to the question, “Why do you say your job is fun?”

“There is a comfort available in studying nature at its unimaginably
small, and learning about the incredible advances in nanotechnology.
The rewards are wonder and amazement at the depth of order and
beauty in the physical world. While we thinking humans are capable of
appreciating this, we are also capable of that which can seem the antithesis of order and beauty. Nature can seem more reliable. Learning more
about our world on the nanoscale and realizing our own membership
in it can, I think, provide a sense of reassuring continuity.”

OPTICAL MICROSCOPES

Many of us have used an optical microscope at home or in the classroom. Optical microscopes focus visible light through a combination
of lenses to produce a magnified image of an object, say a flea’s leg.
Scientists used glass lenses and mirrors to focus and magnify light on an
object. To increase the magnification of a microscope, more lenses are
added to the instrument.
Optical microscopy can distinguish objects in the micrometer range,
which is about 10−6 meters. However, the resolution power of these
instruments is limited to revealing objects down to about 200 nanometers to 250 nanometers magnifications. The tiniest objects we could see
would include red blood cells and small bacteria.
Optical microscopes have technical limitations too. A bacterium can
be seen through a microscope that works with visible light because the
bacterium is larger than the wavelength of visible light. However, tinier

objects such as atoms, molecules, and viruses are invisible because they
are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Therefore, they do not
reflect the light of the image toward our eyes.
Although the optical microscope allows us to see many images, it
leaves a lot of objects that we cannot see, such as viruses, atoms,
molecules, and the DNA helix. To see these objects, we

nomicroscopes.
SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPES

Scanning probe microscopes (SPM) are nano instruments that are
used to study the surface of materials at the nanoscale. The two major
kinds are the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic
force microscope (AFM). SPM enables resolution of features down to
about 1 nanometer in height, allowing imaging of single atoms under
ideal conditions.
Both scanning probe microscopes can provide pictures of atoms on
or in surfaces. The study of surfaces is an important part of physics, with
particular applications in semiconductor physics and microelectronics.
In chemistry, surface chemical reactions also play an important part,
for example, in the process of catalysis. A catalyst is a substance that
produces a change that is used to increase the rate of a chemical reaction
by creating conditions that make the reaction easier to proceed.
SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME AT THE NANOSCALE

Why is the microscope study of surfaces and surface areas so important? Remember in Chapter 2, you read about the difference in surface
area per unit of volume at the nanoscale.
In the nanoworld, the relationship between surface area and volume
is important because the ratio of surface area to volume increases as
objects get smaller and smaller. See illustration and example in Chapter 2. Therefore, since most chemical and physical changes happen on
surfaces, the more surface area the object has the more physical or
chemical changes that can take place. Confused? The next time you
break up one large sugar cube into smaller pieces, you are creating
more surface area in each sugar particles per volume. That is why the
particles will dissolve faster (a physical change) in a liquid than the one
large cube. The sugar particles have more surface area per volume than
the one large cube.

Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM)

The first scanning probe instrument was the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can show
three-dimensional images of individual atoms at the surface.
Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of IBM’s Zurich Laboratory in
Zurich, Switzerland invented this microscope in 1981. The two scientists
received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for their innovation of the STM.
How Does the STM Work?

Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) uses a probe (the tip) to move
over the surface of the material being studied.
The tip of the probe, usually composed of tungsten or platinum, is
extremely sharp. The tip, which consists of a single atom, is attached to
cantilever that looks like a toy diving board with a sharp tip under one
end of it.
The tip slowly scans across the surface at a distance of only an atom’s
diameter. The tip is raised and lowered in order to keep the signal constant and maintain the distance. A small force measures the attraction or
repulsion between the tip and the surface of the sample during scanning.
These forces, causing an up and down movement of the cantilever, are
monitored by a laser beam reflecting off the cantilever surface. Recording the up and down movement of the tip makes it possible to study
the structure of the surface sample. A profile of the wiggled surface is
created, and from that a computer-generated image is produced. The
final image is a contour map of the surface showing trenches and valleys.
The STM works best with conducting materials, but does not work well
with insulators such as rubber.
The STM has many uses and applications in nanotechnology. The
STM can image materials from DNA samples and other biological
molecules. Another examDid you know?

Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM)

The atomic force microscope is sometimes called a Scanning Force
Microscope. The AFM measures the interaction forces between probe
tip and sample.

How Does the AFM Work?

AFM is part of a family of instruments called scanning probe microscopes (SPM). AFM uses a probe moving across the sample’s surface to
identify its features. The probe is a sharp tip, usually made of silicon, at
the end of a cantilever that bends in response to the force between the
tip and the sample being viewed. Any deflection from the sample is measured and the AFM records the surface topography. The topography is
the projections (lumps), depressions (pits), and textures of a surface.
The tip never touches the sample surface because it could damage it.
AFMs are widely used to measure surface topography of many types of
samples.
The atomic force microscope can be operated under two different
conditions (in air or in a vacuum) and two operating modes (contact
or noncontact). Whatever the condition or mode, the basic operating
principles of the AFM remain the same. The AFM uses a probe that
has a tip mounted on a flexible cantilever. The tip is slowly scanned
across the surface of a material, just a few angstroms away from the
surface (noncontact mode) or in contact with it (contact mode). An
angstrom is one tenth (0.1) of a nanometer. The force between the

atoms on the surface of the material and those on the tip cause the tip
to deflect. This deflection can be recorded in various ways, the most
common of which uses a laser focused on the top of the cantilever
and reflected onto photodetectors. A laser is a special type of amplified light beam and is an essential part of CD and DVD players and
recorders.
The photodetector signals are used to map the surface topography
of samples with resolutions down to the nanoscale. At the nanoscale,
the microscope is able to determine roughness, grain size, and features.

the technology was invented in 1986. Presently, the AFM microscopes

The Advantages of AFM

The difference between AFM and other microscopy techniques is
the quality and the measure of resolution. While electron and optical
microscopes provide a standard two-dimensional horizontal view of a
sample’s surface, AFM also provides a vertical view. The resulting images
show the topography of a sample’s surface. While electron microscopes
work in a vacuum, most AFM modes work in dry or liquid environments.
AFM does not require any special sample preparation that could damage
the sample or prevent its reuse.
AFM also can be used for imaging any conducting or nonconducting
surface properties of a substance, while the STM is limited to imaging
only conducting surfaces of a sample. The AFM is a major part of the
$1 billion nanotechnology measurement tools market that is expected
to continue to grow at about 20 percent a year.

AFM Tips

AFM tips are generally made of silicon or silicon nitride. For most
applications, pyramid-shaped silicon nitride tips are used. They are relatively durable and present a dry surface to the sample. Conical silicon tips are often used for biomolecular applications because they are
very sharp and present a wet surface. However, they are relatively less
durable.
Conventional silicon tips are good for measuring relatively flat surfaces, but they do not penetrate the crevices that often exist in small
devices and structures. The silicon tips also wear out quickly, reducing
image resolution.
Magnetic Force Microscopes

The magnetic force microscope (MFM) is another scanning probe
microscope. This microscope has a magnetic tip that is used to probe
the magnetic field above the surface of a sample. The magnetic tip,
mounted on a small cantilever, measures the magnetic interaction between a sample and a tip. The MFM was developed as an evaluation tool
for measuring the magnetism levels in products.
INTERVIEW: NATHAN UNTERMAN

Mr. Nathan A. Unterman is a physics teacher at the Glenbrook
North High School in Northbrook, Illinois. He teaches physics to high
school juniors and seniors. He and his students have built and used
LEGOR models of the atomic force microscope (AFM) and the magnetic force microscope (MFM). The author asked Mr. Unterman about
how his interests in nanotechnology and his work in building LEGOR

a wall-mounted grid and recorded. These positions are recorded in a

Electron microscopes use a beam of high-energy electrons to probe
the sample. Electron microscopes are scientific instruments that use a
beam of highly energetic electrons to examine objects on a very fine
scale. High quality electron microscopes can cost from $250,000 to
$1,000,000. They are one of the most useful instruments in laboratories.

A Scanning Electron Microscope

A scanning electron microscope (SEM) can analyze materials for
information about topography, chemical composition, contamination,
grain size and thickness with far greater depth of field than is possible
with optical microscopy. The depth of field basically means how clear a
three-dimensional image looks.
The topography information analyzed by the SEM includes the surface features of an object such as its texture and hardness. A microscope
operator can observe the shape and size of the grain particles making
up the object and notice if there is any contamination. The composition data includes the elements and compounds that the object is
composed of. How the atoms are arranged in the pattern of the object
can be detected by the crystallographic. The pattern in the crystal is
formed by the way the atoms in a solid material are connected to one
another.
ERNST ABBE

In the 1870s, a man named Ernst Abbe explained why the resolution
of a microscope is limited. He said that since the microscope uses visible

light and visible light has a set range of wavelengths, the microscope
can’t produce the image of an object that is smaller than the length of
the light wave.
The Transmission Electron Microscope

The transmission electron Microscope (TEM) was the first type of
electron microscope to be developed. It was developed by Max Knoll and
Ernst Ruska in Germany in 1931. The transmission electron microscope
(TEM) operates on the same basic principles as the light microscope
but uses electrons instead of light. As mentioned earlier, what you can
see with a light microscope is limited by the wavelength of light. TEMs
use electrons as a “light source” and their much lower wavelength makes
it possible to get a resolution a thousand times better than with a light
microscope. The enlarged version of the image of the specimen appears
on a fluorescent screen or in a layer of photographic film.
You can see objects to the order of .2 nanometers. For example, you
can observe and study small details in the cell or other different materials
down to near atomic levels. The microscope’s high magnification range
and resolution has made the TEM a valuable tool in medical, biological,
and materials research.
Transmission electron microscopy has had an important impact on
the knowledge and understanding of viruses and bacteria. The improvement in resolution provided by electron microscopy has allowed visualization of viruses as the causes of transmissible infectious disease.
Researchers are continuing the use of electron microscopy in the investigation of such pathogens as SARS and the human monkeypox virus.
SARS is a severe acute respiratory disease in humans which is caused by
the SARS virus. Monkeypox is a rare smallpox-like disease that is most
common in the rain forests of central and West Africa.
How Does the TEM Work?

A light source at the top of the microscope emits a beam of electrons
that travel through a vacuum in the column of the microscope. Instead
of glass lenses focusing the light source in the light microscope, the
TEM uses electromagnetic lenses to focus the electrons into a very thin
beam. The electron beam then travels through the specimen you want
to study. Depending on the density of the material present, some of the
electrons are scattered and disappear from the beam. At the bottom of
the microscope the rest of the electrons hit a fluorescent screen. The
screen shows a shadow-like image of the specimen that can be studied
directly by the operator or photographed with a camera.

Scanning Electron Microscope

The first Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) debuted in the
1940s but the first commercial instruments were produced in the
1960s.
The SEM is a type of electron microscope capable of producing highresolution images of a sample surface. Due to the manner in which the
image is created, SEM images have a characteristic three-dimensional appearance and are useful for judging the surface structure of the sample.
This scanning electron microscope has a magnification range from15x
to 200, 000x and a resolution of 5 nanometers.
The SEM has the ability to image large areas of the specimen that
includes thin films and bulky materials as well. In general, SEM images
are much easier to interpret than TEM images.

Bugscope
The Bugscope project is an educational outreach program for K-12 classrooms. The project provides a resource to classrooms so that they may
remotely operate a scanning electron microscope to image “bugs” or “creatures” at high magnification. The microscope is remotely controlled in real
time from a classroom computer over the Internet using a Web browser.
BugScope provides a state-of-the-art microscope resource for teachers that
can be readily integrated into classroom activities. Students can peek at extreme close-up views of the insect world via their school computer labs and
for free.
The BugScope project was developed by the BugScope Project Team
and the Imaging Technology Group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced
Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The scanning electron microscope costs about half a million dollars, and
its main function is for research done at the university by graduate and
postdoctoral students as well as industry.
The team at the institute sets up preset views of the “creatures” provided
by the school. The classroom teacher and students, from a computer station
at their own school, can operate the microscope for other views. Students
watch the images projected on a screen in the front of the computer lab,
and can use their own computer stations to ask questions from the scientists
at the center in Urbana.
The classroom has ownership of the project. The students design their
own experiments and provide their own bugs to be imaged in the microscope. Bugscope provides resources pages with helpful links related to
electron microscopy and bugs. The BugScope Web site: http://bugscope.

HITACHI TABLETOP MICROSCOPE

Hitachi has developed its first tabletop electron microscope, the TM1000. The TM-1000 is designed for researchers who want to break
through the limits of the light microscopy and close up to sophisticated
magnifications up to 10,000.
The microscope is compact, easy to use, is ideal for a wide variety
of applications, and has superior resolution for higher magnification
than an optical microscope. The TM-1000 provides a real alternative
to optical microscopes, stereomicroscopes, and confocal laser scanning
microscopes. It has applications for many areas including life science,
food, cosmetics, health care, pharmaceutical, textiles, materials science,
semiconductor, and education.
NANOFABRICATION CLEANROOM FACILITIES

Scientists need a dust-free workspace to use electron microscopes
and other tools effectively to build small-scale circuits and machines.
The workspace facility is called a cleanroom and it is an important part
of nanotechnology research. In fact it is nearly impossible to conduct
nanoscale research without a cleanroom environment.
Why a cleanroom? On the scale of a nanometer, any particle that is
300 nanometers is huge and is capable of causing short circuits in a
nanoscale electronic circuit.
Cleanroom environments can cost approximately 3 million dollars
to install. Most cleanrooms consist of an air filtration system as well as
temperature and humidity control systems. The system constantly moves
the air down to the floor where it is sucked back into the return air system
and then cleaned and sent back into the room. Some cleanrooms have
yellow illumination that allows researchers to work with light sensitive
materials. The yellow illumination prevents light-sensitive material from
being exposed to ultraviolet light.
As researchers enter the cleanroom, special equipment removes dirt
and dust particles from their shoes. The researchers then put on safety
glasses, gloves, and coveralls over their street clothes, shoes, and hair.
All of the garments are made from lint-free fabrics that are antistatic. It

SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPES
AND PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY

Today the scanning electron microscope is mainly used for the study
of surfaces of materials as well as for the investigation of transparent specimens. Two major applications for the scanning electron microscope are for analyzing and inspecting objects and for photolithography.

Photolithography is a process used to build components on a
micrometer-sized scale. The process uses light to transfer a pattern of say,
a microchip part, from a mask to a light-sensitive chemical photoresist
that forms an image of the pattern on a substrate. The method is like
using silk-screening to make pictures and images from pattern masks
on T-shirts. Photolithography has a broad range of industrial applications, including the manufacture of semiconductors, flat-panel displays,
micromachines, and disk heads.
NANO-IMPRINT LITHOGRAPHY

Today several companies are researching and experimenting with
different kinds of lithographic techniques using nanotechnology. Two
techniques include Dip Pen Nanolithography and Thermal Dip Pen
Nanolithography.
Dip Pen Nanolithography

Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN) is a soft-lithography technique that
uses an AFM scanning probe tip to draw nanostructures. In the DPN
process, a probe tip is coated with liquid ink, which then flows onto the

surface to make patterns wherever the tip makes contact. This directwrite technique offers high-resolution patterning capabilities for a number of molecular and biomolecular “inks” on a variety of substrates.
Substrates are the base material that the images are printed on.
Some of the applications of the DPN technique include sol gel templates that are used to prepare nanotubes and nanowires, and protein
nanoarrays to detect the amount of proteins in biological samples such
as blood.
Thermal Dip Pen Nanolithography

Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Naval
Research Laboratory (NRL) have developed another method for writing
nanometer-scale patterns onto a variety of surfaces.
Their writing method is called thermal dip pen nanolithography,
which is an extension for dip pen nanolithography. The tDPN method
uses easily melted solid inks
and special AFM probes.

repairing circuitry on semiconductor chips. The thermal materials also
provide sharper features because they do not spread out like liquid inks.
NASA VIRTUAL LAB

How would you like to learn how to use an electron microscope in a
virtual lab? Besides the BugScope project, NASA provides a virtual lab
online of an electron microscope for schools, pupils, and teachers. The
free JAVA program allows users a good sense of what the instrument can
do. By downloading the free JAVA program for both PC and Mac, users
can pan, zoom, and even use a built-in ruler to measure such items as a
beetle’s leg, crystals from a human kidney stone, and other objects.
Virtual Lab completely emulates a scanning electron microscope and
allows any user to zoom and focus into a variety of built-in microscopic
samples. It also comes with a set of educational materials such as a demo

NANOMANIPULATORS

One of the major goals in the future is to manufacture products at
the nanoscale. In order to achieve that goal, researchers will need to use
tools that can grab, pickup, push, pull, turnover, tap down, stack, and
move atoms and molecules. To develop the tools needed to do this kind
of work will take more research time.
For now, nanotechnololgists are using and are continuing to develop
new nanomanipulators—tools to manipulate objects in nanometers.
Nanomanipulators are and will be important tools in nanotechnology
research and development,
Presently, scanning probe microscopy, such as the atomic force microscope and the scanning tunneling microscope, is one method to
manipulate objects in nanometers. As an example, the AFM have been
used to move atoms, carbon nanotubes, and to test electronic circuit
boards and integrated circuits.
A few companies are providing add-ons or interfaces to scanning
probe microscopes such as scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) and
atomic force microscopes (AFM). Medical researchers have used a special kind of nanomanipulator to study fibrin fibers, the major components of blood clots. The researchers hope to gain insight into the
healing process by observing the strength and mechanical properties of
blood clots under a variety of conditions.
One company has a kind of nanomanipulator that offers several positions that grasp, move, and test nanoscale samples. This action allows
simultaneous manipulation, imaging, and testing of samples.
NANOFABRICATION

Nanomanipulation will play a big role in nanofabrication. Nanofabrication is the design and manufacture of devices with dimensions

If it can be done, a single atom might even be able to represent a byte
or word of data.
Nanofabrication has also caught the attention of the medical industry,
the military, and the aerospace industry. Nanofabrication methods in the
lines of miniaturization (top-down) and self-assembly (bottom-up) are
essential for the development of nanotechnology.
Top-down fabrication can be likened to making a baseball bat from a
block of wood. The original block of wood is cut down until the desired
shape of the bat is achieved. That is, you start at the beginning or the
top and slowly work your way down removing any wood in the shaping
of the bat that is not needed.
The most common top-down approach to fabrication involves lithographic patterning techniques mentioned earlier in this chapter. The
lithographic process uses short-wavelength light sources.
A major advantage of the top-down approach is that the parts are both
patterned and built in place, so that no assembly step is needed.
Bottom-up nanofabrication is the opposite of top-down nanofabrication. The bottom-up nanofabrication is to build nanostructures atom
by atom using either self-assembly techniques or manipulating atoms by
employing scanning probing microscopy.
Now many industries are adapting nanofabrication technology and
will use it even more in the future. Some of the companies include those
that produce fiber-optic communications, pharmaceuticals, and microelectronics. According to the Federal Government, the unprecedented
spread of nanofabrication and nanotechnology is likely to change the
way almost everything is manufactured—from vaccines to computers to
automobile tires to objects not yet discovered.

How did you get interested
in nanotechnology?
When I was an undergraduate, I was
involved in a project studying the surface chemistry of coal ash particles,
and I was intrigued by how the chemistry of surfaces could be so different from bulk material. In graduate
school I worked with surfaces of a different sort, self-assembled monolayers. These types of monolayers are a
rather simple form of nanotechnology, as they tend to have nanoscale
thicknesses.
What were your favorite subjects
in high school?
I liked a lot of the sciences, because I like to understand how things
work. Ironically, because I was slow in
chemistry lab, I thought in high school that I would go into any science field EXCEPT chemistry. I changed my mind as an undergraduate
because the field was so interesting and employable.

What is scanning probe microscopy (SPM)?
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a method for mapping surface
forces of materials on the atomic scale. By mapping these forces, much
can be learned about the surfaces of materials, where many interesting
and complex phenomena occur. For example, many chemical reactions
involving solids are dependent on the nature of their surfaces. Scanning
probe microscopy includes the methods of atomic force microscopy
(AFM), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), and lateral force microscopy
(LFM). Most force microscopy techniques are variations of the same
basic principle. Forces between the surface and a cantilever tip cause
the tip to deflect up and down or sometimes side to side. Deflection of
the cantilever shifts the position of a laser beam that reflects off the top
of the cantilever onto a photodiode array. The movement of the beam
between the photodiodes is used to calculate the cantilever deflection.
How is a scanning probe microscope useful in nanotechnology
research and in nanofabrication?
The technique is primarily used to map surface forces at the nanoscale,
but the SPM probes have sometimes been used to move objects such as
atoms or “write” with molecular “ink.”

How is the scanning probe microscope different from an atomic force
microscope?
An atomic force microscope can be considered one type of scanning
probe microscopy. Several other types of SPM exist (see: http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning probe microscopy)
How did you and other researchers conceptualize the idea of building
R
a model of a Scanning Probe Microscope from LEGO
building
blocks? Did you try other building materials as well?
A number of people have used different materials to demonstrate SPM,
including wooden sticks, hacksaw blades, and flexible sheet refrigerator
magnets. We opted to use LEGOR bricks for a number of reasons.
First, many people are familiar with LEGOR bricks, and most models
can be built with a level of mechanical sophistication that does not intimidate or frustrate the user. Second, LEGOR bricks typically have many
connection points, allowing tremendous flexibility in the structures that
can be built. A set of bricks can be used to model structures of matter
and the techniques used to study them.
You have taught students how to build a scanning probe microscope
R
blocks. How old were the students who built the
model from LEGO
R

LEGO model and how long did it take them to build it? Were there
any problems in building the model?
Eighth graders as well as graduate students have built various creations
of models. The simplest models can be built within a half hour. More
complicated models take longer to build. The most challenging part of
building the model appears to be mounting the laser pointer.
If a teacher or student wanted to construct the LEGOR model of the
scanning probe microscope, whom should they contact for directions
and for a list of materials?
Most of the directions for making the model are in the online book,
“Exploring the Nanoworld with LEGOR Bricks,” which can be accessed

individuals will need to have a breadth of knowledge in mathematics,
physical sciences and biology, as well as the ability to communicate
effectively with others.
What are some of the benefits of nanotechnology and what would be
some of the risks?
Many technologies stand to benefit from nanotechnology, ranging from
computers to medicine to sunscreen. There are some concerns that
nanoscale chemicals will have different properties and therefore different toxicities than bulk materials. Therefore, nanostructures must be
carefully assessed for potential unexpected hazards.
NANO ACTIVITY: MODELING A SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPE

In this activity, Professor Campbell provides background information
about Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) and ideas on how to build a
LEGOR model of it.
Background Information. Scanning Probe Microscopy
You are likely familiar with microscopes that use light, but many
objects like atoms are too small to be seen using light. Other microscopes use electrons to view even smaller objects, but these also have
difficulty visualizing objects as small as atoms.
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a method for mapping surfaces of materials on the atomic scale. It is useful to study the locations
of atoms on surfaces because many chemical reactions, such as corrosion and catalysis, take place at solid surfaces. Most SPM techniques
are variations of the same basic principles, illustrated in the picture.
At the heart of the microscope is a probe called a cantilever. The
cantilever is fixed at one end and can flex up and down at the other
end like a diving board. A laser beam is shined onto the tip of the cantilever. The light bounces off the top of the cantilever onto a pattern
of light sensors called a photodiode array.
To run the SPM, the cantilever is brought very close to a surface.
The surface is moved back and forth under the cantilever, so the
cantilever more or less scans the surface. Forces between the surface
and a cantilever tip cause the tip to deflect up and down. Deflection
of the cantilever shifts the position of the laser beam that reflects off
the top of the cantilever onto a photodiode array. The movement of
the beam between the photodiodes is used to measure the amount
of cantilever deflection. A computer combines the information

about the cantilever deflection with information about the back and
forth movement about the surface to produce a three-dimensional
map of the surface. This SPM technique is so sensitive that individual atoms can deflect the cantilever probe and therefore be
detected!

http://mrsec.wisc.edu/Edetc/LEGO/index.html.
To get an idea of how your model will look when finished, observe
the triangular LEGOR model in the photo. This model contains a
laser pointer and a cantilever with a triangular LEGOR probe on its
underside and a mirror atop it. In this model, the cantilever tip is
in physical contact with a LEGOR surface. The LEGOR pegs on the
surface deflect the cantilever. Light from the pocket laser reflects
from the mirror on the cantilever and shines onto a wall.
After you build your model, have someone attach small bricks to
the LEGO surface and then place the SPM behind a screen. Using
the laser beam spot movement and horizontal surface movement, try
to map the locations of the small bricks on the surface. Sketch your
map of the surface on a sheet of paper.
Placing 1x1 bricks on a flat plate “substrate” makes raised bumps to
push the cantilever (and the laser beam spot) up and down. A “handle” can be attached to this substrate and used to map to positions of
the bumps. Place the SPM and substrate on a sheet of paper. Move the
substrate back and forth (with the handle always pointing in the same
direction). When a bump pushes the beam spot up, make a mark on
the paper at the end of the handle. Note that the map produced will
be rotated 180O from the actual bump positions.
Questions to Explore
1. Will a bump on a flat surface move the laser spot up or down?
2. How does the distance the SPM is positioned from the wall affect how
much the laser beam spot shifts?

Carbon Nanotubes,
Nanowires, and
Nanocrystals
Carbon is one of the most abundant elements in living things and materials derived from living things. By volume, carbon is about the fourth
most abundant element in the universe.
As you learned in Chapter 2, elements are types of atoms that make up
all the things around us. Carbon plays an important role in nanotechnology research and for potential nanotechnology applications. Before
we discuss the role of carbon as nanoparticles, let’s review some general
information about the chemical and physical properties of carbon in
the macro-world.
THE ELEMENT CARBON

The chemical element carbon (C), is found in many different compounds. It is in the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the cosmetics
we use, and the gasoline that fuels our cars. Carbon plays a dominant role in the chemistry of life and without carbon we could not
exist.
Carbon is a naturally occurring nonmetallic element that is present
in the cells of all organisms. Carbon has an atomic number of 6
and an atomic weight of 12. The carbon atom contains six neutrons
and six protons and combines with other elements forming a variety of compounds that include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
Carbon makes up about 19 percent of the mass of the human body and
is an essential component of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and nucleic
acids. All fossil fuels, coal, petroleum, oil shale, and natural gas, contain
carbon as a principal element and combined with hydrogen form a
category of hydrocarbons.

Products Made from Carbon

As noted, carbon can combine with other elements as well as with
itself. This ability allows carbon to form many different compounds of
varying size, strengths, and shape. Carbon is used in synthetic materials called composites that contain both carbon fiber and fiberglass
reinforcement.
Light yet strong, carbon composites have many applications in
aerospace and automotive fields, as well as in sailboats, and notably
in modern bicycles. Carbon is also becoming increasingly common in
small consumer goods as well, such as laptop computers, tripods, fishing
rods, tennis racket frames, stringed instrument bodies, classical guitar
strings, and even drum shells.
Some Uses of Carbon
Graphite combines with clays to form the “lead” used in pencils.
A diamond is used for decorative purposes, and also as drill bits.
Carbon is added to iron to make steel.
Carbon in the form of graphite is used for control rods in nuclear reactors.
Graphite carbon in a powdered cake form is used as charcoal for cooking,
artwork, and other uses.
Charcoal (carbon)is a constituent of gunpowder.

Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires, and Nanocrystals

Charcoal pills are used in medicine in pill or powder form to adsorb toxins
or poisons from the digestive system.
Different Forms of Carbon

There are several different allotropes or forms of carbon. Each form
has a different molecular structure. The forms include amorphous,
graphite, diamond, and fullerene.
The term amorphous means lacking a definite form or having no specific shape. In chemistry, the term amorphous means that the substance
is lacking a crystalline form. For example, soot is an amorphous carbon
that is a dark powdery deposit of unburned fuel residues. Glass, amber,
wax, rubber, and plastics are other examples of amorphous substances.
Amorphous carbon has been found in comets.
However, the other forms of carbon—diamonds, graphites, and
fullerenes—have definite crystalline forms. Graphite is a very soft mineral consisting of loosely bond atoms arranged in a two-dimensional
crystalline form that looks like a thin flat plane. This property makes
graphite a good natural lubricant because it’s flat, planar structure allows the nanoscale sheets of graphite to slide past one another easily. Although the mineral is soft, graphite’s strength and its ability
to conduct electricity makes the mineral especially useful in nanotechnology.
There are two main classifications of graphite, natural and synthetic.
Graphite minerals can be found naturally in the Earth’s crust. Synthetic
graphite is made from petroleum coke.
Besides pencil production, graphite is also used to manufacture crucibles, ladles, and moulds for containing molten metals. Graphite is
mainly used as electrical material in the manufacturing of carbon
brushes in electric motors. Highly pure graphite is used in large amounts
for the production of moderator rods and other components in nuclear
reactors. The moderator in the nuclear reactor is used to slow down
the neutrons so that the right speed is maintained for a steady fission
rate.
Some other uses of graphite include:
r Aerospace applications
r Batteries

r Carbon brushes
r Graphite electrodes for electric arc furnaces for metallurgical processing.
r Graphite lubricants

Diamond

The hardest known natural mineral is diamond. The diamond contains carbon atoms that are stacked or arranged in a three-dimensional
form or array. This structure makes the diamond super hard for the
cutting and grinding of metals and other materials. Unlike graphite, a
diamond is not a good conductor of electricity but the mineral is an
excellent thermal conductor.
Applications of diamonds are used in a variety of products that include laser diodes and small microwave power device, integrated circuit
substrates, and printed circuit boards. Diamond is starting to be used
in optical components, particularly as a protective coating for infrared
optics in harsh environments.
Diamond provides an impressive combination of chemical, physical,
and mechanical properties: Some of these properties include:
r Low coefficient of friction

r High thermal conductivity
r High electrical resistance

r Low thermal expansion coefficient

FULLERENES AND NANOTECHNOLOGY

Fullerenes are the third allotropic form of carbon material (after
graphite and diamond). Fullerenes are large molecules of carbon that

This compares to 0.16 nanometer for a water molecule.
Fullerenes were discovered during laser spectroscopy experiments at
Rice University in September 1985. The 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Professors Robert F. Curl, Jr., Richard E. Smalley,
and Sir Harold W. Kroto for their discovery. Fullerenes were named
after Richard Buckminster Fuller, an architect known for the design of
geodesic domes, which resemble spherical fullerenes in appearance.

covered some possible uses
for these molecules. Some of
these potential applications include being used in making computers,
fuel cells, and sensors.
Major pharmaceutical companies are exploring the use of fullerenes
in drugs to control the neurological damage of such diseases as
Alzheimer’s disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS). Companies are
also testing the use of fullerenes in drugs for atherosclerosis and for use
in antiviral agents.
A group of medical researchers believe that fullerenes could be used
in tiny special sponges that would soak up dangerous chemicals from
any tissues in the brain that have been injured. The sponges would immobilize the dangerous chemicals that would, if left untreated, destroy
the nerve cells.
CARBON NANOTUBES

Scientists discovered that if you can make buckyballs big enough, they
could become carbon cylinders called carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are long, thin cylinders of carbon molecules. A carbon nanotube
is a completely different material from either diamond or graphite.

Sumio Iijima, of NEC Corporation came upon carbon nanotubes in
1991 in Tsukuba, Japan, while researching buckyballs using an electron
microscope. The carbon nanotubes he discovered can be visualized as
a two-dimensional sheet of graphite. The arrangement of carbon atoms
into a hexagonal lattice is called “graphene,” because it has the form
of a graphite sheet rolled into a cylinder. The nanotube looks like a
rolled-up piece of chicken wire.
Carbon nanotubes have unique properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications such as in nanoelectronics,
optics, and materials applications. They exhibit extraordinary strength
and unique electrical properties, and are efficient conductors of
heat.

Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires, and Nanocrystals

Two Types of Nanotubes

There are two main types of nanotubes: single-walled nanotubes
(SWNTs) and multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs).
Most SWNTs have a diameter of close to 1 nanometer, with a tube
length that can be many thousands of times longer. In fact, SWNTs
can reach the length of centimeters. The structure of a SWNT can be
conceptualized by wrapping a one-atom-thick layer of graphite called
graphene into a cylinder. A graphene is a two-dimensional single sheet
of carbon-bonded atoms.
A single-walled nanotube is commonly called a buckytube and consists of one single shell. The nanotube is cylindrical, with at least one
end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. The
diameter of a nanotube is only a few nanometers wide and can extend
up to 50 microns in length.
Nanotubes have the following physical, chemical, and mechanical
properties that make them such an outstanding material:
r Electrical conductivity: Depending on their precise structure, carbon nanotubes can be either metallic conductors or semiconductors.
The electrons in nanotubes can travel much faster than in metals
such as copper, and they do not dissipate or scatter. The electrical conductivity of the nanotubes could be useful in absorbing static
noise, storing energy, or in replacing silicon circuits in computer
chips.
r Thermal conductivity: The thermal conductivity of nanotubes is superior
to that of a diamond. In some tests, nanotubes have been shown to have a
thermal conductivity at least twice that of diamond. The nanotubes could
be potentially handy for cooling off confined spaces inside computers and
other nanoelectronics.
r Mechanical: Nanotubes are the stiffest, strongest, and toughest fiber
known. For their small size, nanotubes are six times lighter than steel
but more than 500 times stronger. They could be used to replace copper
wires or to create superstrong plastics.

MWNTs are multiwalled nanotubes which may have 7–20 concentric
grapheme cylinders. Double-walled carbon nanotubes have higher thermal and chemical stability than single-walled carbon nanotubes. MWNT
can be applied to gas sensors, nanoelectronic devices, and nanocomposites.

HOW ARE CARBON NANOTUBES MADE?

There are several basic methods by which carbon nanotubes are made.
Scientists can make modifications to each technique to suit their specific
research purpose.
Laser Ablation

A high-power laser is used to vaporize carbon from a graphite target
at high temperature. The resulting “soot” is collected by a water-cooled
collector. This method is used to form single-walled nanotubes.
Electric Arc Discharge

In the electric arc discharge method, an electric current flows between two graphite rods. One graphite rod acts as an anode (a negative

form nanotubes. This method produces mostly multi-walled nanotubes.
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)

In this method of making carbon nanotubes, metal catalyst particles
are placed on a surface, such as a silicon wafer, and heated to high temperatures in a hydrocarbon gas. The high temperature and the catalyst
particles break apart the hydrogen and the carbon atoms in the gas. A
nanotube grows out from the catalyst and grows longer and longer as
more carbon atoms are released from the gas. This method produces
both multiwalled and single-walled nanotubes depending on the temperature.
APPLICATIONS OF CARBON NANOTUBES

Carbon nanotubes are the driving force for current advances in nanotechnology; they have excellent mechanical and electronic properties,

the latter making them extremely attractive for electronics. Being only
a few times wider than atoms, the carbon nanotubes offer exceptionally
high material properties, such as electrical and thermal conductivity,
stiffness, toughness, and remarkable strength.
Sheets of carbon nanotubes have the following features:
r The sheets are transparent and stronger than steel or high-strength plastics and can be heated to emit light.
r A square mile of the thinnest sheets, about 2-millionths-of-an-inch thick,
would weigh only about 170 pounds.
r In lab tests, the sheets demonstrated solar cell capabilities for using sunlight to produce electricity.

Other potential applications of carbon nanotubes include the following.

Flat Panel Display Screens

When a nanotube is put into an electric field, it will emit electrons
from the end of the nanotube like water being pushed through a highpowered water hose. If the electrons bombard a phosphor screen, then
an image can be created. Several companies are researching how to
use this nanotube technology to replace the bulky electron guns of
conventional TV sets with smaller carbon nanotube electron guns.
Nanoscale Electronics and Carbon Nanotubes

Many nanoelectronic companies are interested in developing new
methods to manufacture transistors. Transistors are the key component
of the electrical circuit that is used in the operation of computers, cellular phones, and other electronic devices. In fact transistors are used in
nearly every piece of electronic equipment today.
The transistors are a key building block of electronic systems—they
act as bridges inside the computer chip that carry data from one place
to another. The more transistors on a chip, the faster the processing
speed.
To manufacture more transistors on a chip, several companies are now
experimenting on how to make the channel length in the transistors
smaller and smaller. The
channel in the transistor is

side chips. Some success in
this area has already happened. One company has successfully used
carbon nanotubes to make smaller channels in the production of their
transistors.
The achievement of making smaller channels in the production of
transistors is an important step in finding materials, such as carbon nanotubes, to be used to manufacture computer chips.

bles every 18 months. But
many scientists expect that within 10–20 years the present computer
chip made with silicon will reach its physical limits. The ability to pack
more transistors on the chip will no longer be feasible. So the application of carbon nanotubes in transistors may help increase the storage
problem on a chip.

AFM PROBE TIPS

Single-walled carbon nanotubes have been attached to the tip of an
AFM probe to make the tip “sharper.” This allows much higher resolution imaging of the surface under investigation; a single atom has been
imaged on a surface using nanotube-enhanced AFM probes. Also, the
flexibility of the nanotube prevents damage to the sample surface and
the probe tip if by accident the probe tip slams into the surface.
Hydrogen Fuel Cells and Nanotubes

There is a global effort today to develop renewable energy sources. A
great deal of research is being devoted to the production of hydrogen
fuel cells. A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy-conversion device.
Most fuel cells in use today use hydrogen and oxygen as the chemicals.
When oxygen and hydrogen react in a fuel cell electricity is produced
and water is formed as a by-product.
To use a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell to generate electricity, scientists
and engineers must find a safe way to store hydrogen gas in the fuel tank.
Hydrogen gas takes up a lot of volume. Carbon nanotube materials built
into the inside of the tank may be an excellent option.
Carbon nanotubes are extremely porous. So, acting like a sponge,

While nanotube-based hydrogen cells for automobiles look promising, it may be awhile before any large numbers of hydrogen fuel cell
automobiles are on the road.
Actuators/Artificial Muscles

An actuator is a device that can provide motion. In a carbon nanotube
actuator, electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy causing the
nanotubes to move.
Here is how it works. Two pieces of paper made from carbon nanotubes are placed on either sides of a piece of tape that is attached to an

electrode. An electrode is a conductor through which electric current
is passed.
When electric current is applied the electrons are pumped into one
piece of the paper. The nanotubes on that side of the paper expand
causing the tape to curl in one direction. This curling movement is
similar to the way an artificial muscle works. The nanotube actuator can
produce 50 to 100 times the force of a human muscle the same size.
Researchers see the possible applications of the nanotube actuator for
robotics and prosthetics.
Nanotechnology in Chemical Sensors

Sensors are used in our everyday life even though they seem to be out
of our sight. There are motion sensors, acoustic sensors, electrical power
sensors, distance sensors, mechanical sensors, and chemical sensors.
Sensors are used in automobiles, machines, aircraft, medicine, industry,
and robotics.
Nanotechnology researchers are now developing and improving upon
chemical sensors, using nanoparticles. Chemical sensors detect the presence of very small amounts of specific chemical vapors or classes of
chemicals.
You are probably familiar with a carbon monoxide detector. A carbon monoxide detector is a chemical sensor often used in the home.
These detectors continually sample the air in the rooms and will sound
an alarm if the invisible and odorless carbon monoxide levels become
dangerous in the home and workplace.
Researchers now want to develop small, inexpensive sensors that can
sniff out chemicals just as dogs do when they are used in airports to
smell the vapors given off by explosives or drugs hidden in packages
or in other containers. These small and inexpensive sensors can be
placed throughout an airport, shopping mall, or building where security
measures are needed, to check for vapors given off by explosive devices.
These sensors can also be useful in industrial plants that use chemicals
in manufacturing to detect the release of chemical vapors.
Using a chemical sensor to detect a chemical vapor is fine, but you
want to be able to identify and analyze the gas vapor quickly. You want to
know what it is. Is it OK
to breathe? Is it dangerous?

with sarin, it is known by its NATO designation of GB (O-Isopropyl
methylphosphonofluoridate), an extremely toxic substance whose only
application is as a nerve agent. As a chemical weapon, it is classified as a
weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. In 1995, there was a
sarin gas attack on a Tokyo, Japan, subway that killed several people and
injured many others.
In the future, nanotube chemical sensors can play an important role
in security and environmental applications.
Carbon Nanotubes and NASA

Carbon nanotubes may offer the possibility of detecting harmful ionizing radiation during interplanetary space missions. Radiation damages
DNA in living cells, leading to health problems such as nausea, cataracts,
and cancer.
Radiation hazards in space travel come in the form of trapped radiation, galactic cosmic rays, and solar particle events. To detect and
monitor the radiation, NASA is developing a carbon nanotube dosimeter. A dosimeter is any device used to measure an individual’s dose to a
hazardous environment. The carbon nanotube dosimeter would detect
and measure the radiation by monitoring changes in the conductivity of
a nanotube sensor. Studies have shown that nanotube conductivity levels
in the dosimeter increase with radiation and then decrease after that.
An increase in radiation doses in a spacecraft would warn the astronauts
to take action.
NASA Space Elevator

NASA is also planning a space elevator that would be attached to a
cable that would orbit Earth at a height of 36,000 kilometers. Scientists
believe that the cable could be made from carbon nanotubes that are
100 times stronger than steel. See Chapter 8 for more information about
NASA’s plans for the space elevator.
NOT ALL NANOTUBES ARE CARBON

One company has found a way to make commercial quantities of naturally occurring nanotubes that are not carbon. The halloysite nanotubes,
containing the elements aluminum, silicon, hydrogen, and oxygen, are
found in halloysite clay found in the soil in certain areas in the country. Halloysite clay has historically been used to make fine china and
ceramics.

Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires, and Nanocrystals

The company, NaturalNano, is developing methods of processing the
halloysite clay into nanotubes for use in commercial applications. The
halloysite nanotubes can be used in such products as additives in polymers and plastics, electronic components, cosmetics, and absorbents.
NANOWIRES, NANOCRYSTALS, AND QUANTUM DOTS
Nanowires

A nanometer-scale wire is made of metal atoms, silicon, or other
materials that conduct electricity. Nanowires are built atom by atom on
a solid surface.
A nanowire is a very small wire that is composed of either metals or
semiconductors. It is also known as a nanorod or quantum wire since
the dimensions of the nanowire are in the order of a nanometer (10−9
meters). The nanowires have the potential to be used as components to
create electrical circuits.
Production of Nanowires

The fabrication of a nanowire can be done either with vapor deposition using specialty gases, or with a laser aimed at a target material to
produce a specific vapor. The gases eventually condense on a substrate
material, like silicon, forming a nanowire.
The tiny nanowires have the potential to be used in medical applications. A tiny nanowire sensor used in medical diagnostic tests is 1,000
times more sensitive than conventional tests. The nanosensor is capable
of producing test results in minutes rather than in days or weeks. This
feature could pave the way for faster and more accurate medical diagnostic tests that would allow earlier disease detection and intervention.
Several companies are developing nanowire devices. These devices
will be used for chemical sensing, lasers and light-emitting diodes, and,
in the future, nanoelectronics.
Nanocrystals

Nanocrystals are grown from inorganic materials, including metals
and semiconductors. Some researchers have made nanocrystals of silver,
gold, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium. Nanocrystals are approximately 10 nanometers in diameter.
Some of the potential applications will include using nanocrystals
as building blocks for producing strong metals and composites. The
technology is also applicable to lighting, high-resolution imaging, and
semiconductor materials. Since nanocrystals emit colored light, they

will have a big impact on how everything from large-screen televisions
to portable electronics are manufactured.
In fact, nanocrystals could be the next generation of photovoltaics.

cells that generate energy at
an installed photovoltaic system cost (capital cost of system) of less than
under a dollar per watt. This would mean having a 5-KW system for less
than $5,000, which would be competitive with fossil fuel prices.
Quantum Dots

A quantum dot is a semiconductor nanocrystal that is about 1 to 6
nanometers in diameter. It has a spherical or cubic-like shape consisting
of thousands of atoms,
A quantum dot is made of cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium sulfide
(CdS), or cadmium telluride (CdTe) and then coated with a polymer.
The coating is used to prevent these toxic chemicals from leaking.
The CdS is used for UV-blue, the CdSe for the bulk of the visible
spectrum, and the CdTe for the far red and near infrared. The particle’s
size determines the exact color of a given quantum dot.
A wide range of colors can be emitted from a single material simply by
changing the dot’s size and makeup. A larger dot emits the red end of the
spectrum and the smaller ones emit blue or ultraviolet. As an example,
a cadmium selenide (CdSe)

glows green.
Quantum dots could help scientists image the behavior of cells and
organs to a level of detail never before seen. Conventional fluorescent
dyes used in the life sciences to help researchers monitor how cells
and organs grow and develop normally lose their ability to emit light
within seconds. On the other side, quantum dots emit light far longer,
helping scientists monitor cells and organs in diseased and healthy
conditions.

Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires, and Nanocrystals

The wide range of colors that can be produced by quantum dots
makes them well suited for a variety of applications. As an example,
they have great potential in security. Quantum dots could, for example,
be embedded in banknotes or credit cards, producing a unique visible
image when exposed to ultraviolet light. The image would identify the
rightful owner of the credit card or banknote. Quantum dots could also
be used in electronics applications such as data storage, light-emitting
diodes, photovoltaic devices, flat-panel displays, and in medical aplications.
Quantum Dots and Cancer

Emory University scientists have used luminescent quantum dot
nanoparticles in living animals to simultaneously target and image cancerous tumors. The quantum dots were first coated with a protective
shell covering. Then special antibodies were attached to the surface
of the quantum dots. After the quantum dots were injected into the
body, they were guided to the prostate tumor of the living mice. Using a mercury lamp, the scientists were able to see the surface of the
tumor illuminated by the accumulation of quantum dots on the cell.
The scientists believe the ability to both target and image cells in vivo
(in the body) represents a significant step in the quest to eventually
use nanotechnology to target, image, and treat cancer, cardiovascular
plaques, and neurodegenerative disease in humans. See Chapter 5 for
more information about nanotechnology and nanomedicine.
Quantum Dots for Solar Cells

Scientists have been doing a lot of research with quantum dots to
make photovoltaic cells more efficient. Presently, much of the solar
energy striking photovoltaic cells is wasted. Here is why. When solar
photons, fundamental light particles, strike a solar cell, they release
electrons in the semiconductor to produce an electric current. However,
when an electron is set free by the photon, it collides often with a
nearby atom. The collision makes it less likely to set another electron
free. So even though solar photons carry enough energy to release
several electrons, producing more electricity, they are limited to one
electron per solar photon, according to solar experts. As a result, most
conventional solar cells operate at 15 to 20 percent efficiency using solar
energy.
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
and the Los Alamos National Laboratory have been experimenting with
quantum dots as a semiconductor in a solar cell. They have discovered

that the use of the quantum dots allows solar energy to release multiple
electrons, not just one. This research has the potential to make major improvements in the manufacturing of photovoltaic cells. The two
research teams have calculated that a maximum efficiency of solar conversion at 42 percent efficiency is possible from the conversion of solar
energy to electricity. So, more efficient solar cells are in the development
stage.
NANOSHELLS

Nanoshells are a new type of nanoparticle composed of a substance
such as a silica core that is coated with an ultrathin metallic such as a
gold layer. Nanoshells are about 1/20th the size of a red blood cell and
are about the size of a virus or about 100 nanometers wide. They are
ball-shaped and consist of a core of nonconducting glass that is covered
by a metallic shell, typically either gold or silver.
Nanoshells are currently being investigated as a treatment for cancer similar to chemotherapy but without the toxic side effects. These
nanoshells can be injected safely into the body as demonstrated in animal tests. Once in the body, the nanoshells are illuminated with a laser
beam that gives off intense heat that destroys the tumor cells.
In preliminary testing, one research medical team is using nanoshells
combined with lasers to kill oral cancer cells. Oral cancer is a cancerous tissue growth located in the mouth. Smoking and other tobacco
use are associated with 70 percent to 80 percent of oral cancer cases.
Approximately 30,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal cancer each year. Human clinical trials using applications of
nanoshells for cancer treatment will begin within a few years. However,
nanoshells are already being developed for other applications. They include drug delivery and testing for proteins associated with Alzheimer’s
disease.

Carbon Nanotubes, Nanowires, and Nanocrystals

Where did you grow up and what were some of your favorite activities
and subjects as a teenager?
I grew up and went to schools in northern California near San Francisco.
As a young person, I enjoyed the outdoors and nature. I was interested
in collecting insects, bird watching, and I was very active in the Audubon
Society, as well. I hiked and explored the wetlands and hills in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
What colleges did you attend and what was your major?
After I graduated from high school, I attended the University of
California, Berkeley where I received all of my degrees including my
Ph.D. degree in Materials Science.
What subjects do you teach at Purdue University?
I teach materials engineering, electrical engineering, and nanotechnology to undergraduates and graduate students.
What is materials engineering?
Materials engineering is the study of the relationships between composition, processing, microstructure, and properties of materials with
the aim of improving the performance of materials that are used for
everything from bridges to biochips.
What are your duties as the Director, Birck Nanotechnology Center?
My principal duty as the director is to facilitate the research projects at
the Center. We have 45 resident faculty members and 200 resident graduate students. Since all of them come from a broad range of disciplines,
as many as 30 disciplines, they need to learn how to work together. As an
example, in our research projects, a biologist would be working with an
engineer. So, my duties at the center are to facilitate the interdisciplinary
work of the group projects.
What is your science background and how did you get interested in the
field of carbon nanotubes and nanotechnology?
While at Berkeley as a student, I was able to take 50 percent of my classes
in engineering and the other 50 percent in science courses. The science
courses were mostly in the field of physics.
I was always interested in small things such as atoms in crystals and
molecular structures. I did not get interested in carbon nanotubes until
I ran into a colleague at Purdue. His name is Timothy Fisher, and he is
a mechanical engineer and professor at Purdue University.
Tim is an expert in carbon nanotubes and one day we started talking
about our interests. I was working on nanoporous materials and he was

working on nanotubes. So, we decided to combine our interests and lab
experiences to see if we could grow the carbon nanotubes inside a porous
material. This experience got me interested in carbon nanotubes. While
working as a team, we both also learned more about each other’s fields
of study.
When we use the term, nanoelectronics, what are we talking about?
Nanoelectronics to me really talks about bridging bottom-up nanofabrication with top-down nanofabrication to manufacture electronic systems. I think we are at the point where top-down nanofabrication is
slowing down (running out of gas) and it is getting very expensive to
use this method for manufacturing nanoelectronic circuits. So, now we
need to learn ways to use the bottom-up nanofabrication approach in
concert with top-down nanofabrication to make things at the nanoscale.
This, of course, is a big challenge. The big opportunity is that carbon
nanotubes have properties that are extraordinary, and if you can harness
these properties, you would indeed be able to make higher performing
nano devices and a higher performance chip.
How important are carbon nanotubes in the field of nanoelectronics?
Carbon nanotubes stand out because they may offer the biggest potential for nanotechnology breakthroughs. One reason is that the carbon
nanotubes have high thermal conductivity, the highest of any known material. A major problem or bottleneck today in electronics is the removal
of excessive heat in the active region of the chip. Single-walled carbon
nanotubes could solve this problem because they would not overheat.
Electrons also move readily in carbon nanotubes, which makes devices
switch faster.
How did you and Professor Fisher develop a technique to grow
individual carbon nanotubes vertically on top of a silicon wafer?
Growing nanotubes vertically allows us to stack more transistor circuits
and other components in a computer chip, while keeping the same
footprint as a conventional chip. This would be the electronic equivalent
of a skyscraper.
We grow individual nanotubes vertically out of tiny cavities on top of
a silicon wafer. This “vertically oriented” technique of growing carbon
nanotubes on top of a silicon wafer might be an important step towards
new kinds of computer chips with nanoelectronic devices, including
wireless equipment and sensors.
Growing carbon nanotubes vertically on a silicon wafer may be a new
way of constructing future microchips that are much faster to make and
more energy efficient than conventional chips. Stacking the components
on top of each other also cuts the distance and the time an electrical

signal needs to travel in a microchip. But more research work needs to
be conducted using this technique.
How do you grow the nanotubes?
We start with a porous material that is easy to make. The porous material is formed directly on the surface of a silicon wafer. In the process of
making the porous material, we embedded a catalyst inside the pores.
The catalyst particles are used to nucleate the nanotubes in a specific location. The wafer is placed in a plasma-enhanced deposition system that
creates a carbon vapor that, when in contact with the catalyst particles,
starts the growth of a carbon nanotube. The nanotubes self assemble
and only one carbon nanotube forms per pore. There is no way a second
nanotube will form in the same pore. The nanotubes grow vertically and
eventually project out of the pores.
What tools and equipment did you use in growing the nanotubes? Did
you need to work in a cleanroom environment?
We use all the state-of-the-art tools and equipment we can get to do
our work. Students building the vertical carbon nanotubes use scanning

probe microscopes to measure the properties of the tubes. They use
scanning electron microscopes to observe what they are doing because
you cannot see these nanomaterials with a light optical microscope.
Other techniques include using advanced lithography, a form of printing, to make patterns in a cleanroom environment. Students use an electron beam patterning system to write very fine lines, as narrow as about
10 nanometers, or about 50 atoms across. Lasers are used to measure
properties of individual nanotubes to determine their semiconducting
or metallic properties.
Does Purdue University collaborate with major computer companies?
There is much informal collaboration that goes on between universities
and major computer chip corporations.
What advice would you give young people who would be interested in a
career in nanotechnology?
Certainly, anyone thinking about nanotechnology should take the basic
classes in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. If students and
teachers are interested in learning more about nanotechnology, I would
recommend that they visit, nanoHUB.org., the Web site of the Network for
Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). The NCN, led by Purdue, is a large
network of many colleges and universities throughout the country and
is funded by the National Science Foundation.
The original idea of the network was to put up simulation tools for
researchers, but it turns out that the most popular section of the Web site
is the tutorial section, attracting all levels of viewers, from high school
students to those taking college courses.
The categories on the nanoHUB include Simulate, Research, Teach and
Learn, and Contribute. The Teach and Learn site is a good place to start
for someone who wants an introduction to nanotechnology. The topics include: Nano 101, Nanocurriculum, Learning Modules, and Teaching
Materials for K-12 and Undergraduates.

Nanotechnology in
Medicine and Health
One of the most promising applications of nanotechnology is nanomedicine. Nanomedicine is defined as the application and development of nanoscale tools and machines designed to monitor health care,
deliver drugs, cure diseases, and repair damaged tissues. Nanomedical
research will be an essential tool to diagnose, treat, and to do follow-up
care in major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes,
and other diseases.
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES

Cardiovascular diseases are the most frequent cause of death in the
United States, Europe, and the world, according to the World Health
Organization. In the United States, cardiovascular disease accounts for
twice as many deaths as all cancers in the country. Over 13 million people
in the United States have coronary heart disease (CHD). Americans
suffer approximately 1.5 million heart attacks annually and about half
of them prove fatal, according to medical researchers.
To help diagnose and treat heart patients, one group, The National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) have awarded researchers from Georgia Institute of
Technology and Emory University $11.5 million to establish a new research program focused on creating advanced nanotechnologies to analyze plaque formation on the molecular level and to detect plaque at
its early stages. Plaques, containing cholesterol and lipids, may build
up during the life of blood vessels. When these plaques become unstable and rupture they can block the vessels, leading to heart attack and
stroke.

magnetic nanoparticles.
A molecular beacon is a biosensor. A biosensor is an analytical instrument capable of detecting biological molecules. The molecular beacon,
only 4 to 5 nanometers in size, will seek out and detect specific target
genes in the cells. Each cell in the human body contains about 25,000
to 35,000 genes that determine your traits. Scientists are studying genes
to determine what illnesses genes cause.
The light emitted from the beacon will create a glowing marker if
the cell has a detectable level of a gene that is known to contribute to
cardiovascular disease.
The second type of probe is the semiconductor quantum dots. This
is also used to study the molecules of cardiovascular disease. Quantum
dot-based probes can be used to study interactions in live cells or to
detect diseased cells. These ultrasensitive probes may help cardiologists
understand the formation of early stage plaques and dramatically improve detection sensitivity.
The last probe in their research will include the nanostructured
probe—magnetic nanoparticles. This probe will detect early-stage
plaques in patients. The magnetic nanoparticles will target the surface
of cells in a plaque and provide an image of the plaque formation. This
technique could become a powerful tool for better disease diagnosis.
What Causes Cardiovascular Diseases?

One of the major causes of cardiovascular disease in most cases is the
formation of plaque in the blood vessels. The plaque can lead to the
clogging of the blood vessels causing death, disability, or strokes. Strokes
are caused by ruptured blood vessels leaking blood into the brain.
Here are some symptoms of stroke:
r Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, particularly if it is
on one side of the body
r Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding. Sudden difficulty
with walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination

r Sudden trouble seeing from one or both eyes
r Sudden severe headache with no known cause.
Nanoparticles Break Down Blood Clots

Strokes and other kinds of heart attacks are also caused by the formation of blood clots in the circulatory system. Blood clots can lead to a
range of serious medical conditions, including heart attacks, pulmonary
embolisms, and strokes. The main component of a clot is the insoluble
fibrin. Fibrin is a blood-clotting protein and has a role in normal and
abnormal clot formation (coagulation) in the body.
One research group is experimenting with different ways of treating
fibrin. One test involves the use of nanoparticle drugs that dissolve and
break up the fibrin. Preventing blood clots reduces the risk of stroke,
heart attack, and pulmonary embolism.
Another research team is experimenting with a cardiovascular
method that employs specially made molecules called “nanolipoblockers.” The nanolipoblockers

In preliminary tests, these molecules show good results against harmful cholesterol.

Heart Stents and Nanotechnology

Doctors have used special stents for heart patients to open arteries
that have become too narrow due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis
is the cholesterol plaque that builds up on the inner walls of arteries.
As noted earlier, the plague prevents the blood vessels from carrying
oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. The blockage of the blood flow
can lead to a stroke or heart attack.
During or after heart surgery, a stent is inserted permanently into an
artery. The stent, the size of a small metal tube, keeps the artery open,
which improves blood flow, and helps prevent buildup of plague. The
stent also enables the arteries to grow new tissue after the vessel-clogging
plaque deposits have been removed.
However, some problems can occur with stents. The stent placement
in the body can cause infection, blood clots, or bleeding. One major

problem is that the body’s immune system can reject the metal stents.
When this happens, the immune system can cause the creation of scar
tissue. In some cases, the scar tissue can build up inside blood vessels
and interfere with blood flow.
Now, nanoresearchers are using a variety of methods to find new materials that cause the cells to attach better to these stents without creating
as much dangerous scar tissue. One research company

from any potentially harmful
interactions with metal stents.
CANCER DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS

Cancer is currently the second leading cause of death in the United
States and Europe. Detection of cancer at an early stage is a critical step
in improving cancer treatment. Currently, detection and diagnosis of
cancer usually depend on changes in cells and tissues that are detected
by a doctor’s physical exam or by laboratory-generated images on film.
Scientists would like to make it possible to detect cancer at the earliest
changes in cells or tissues before a physical exam.
Cancer

To detect cancer at its earliest stages, the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) has invested 144 million dollars to develop and apply nanotechnology to cancer. The NCI envisions that within the next 5 years nanotechnology will result in significant advances in early detection, molecular imaging, assessment of therapeutic methods, and prevention and
control of cancer. Cancer is an abnormal growth of cells anywhere in
the body. It occurs when the genes in a cell allow it to split (make new
cells) without control. There are many kinds of cancer, because there
are many kinds of cells in the body. Some cancers form growths called
tumors, while others, like cancers of the blood (leukemias), travel all
over the body. Cancers may harm the body in two ways. They may replace normal cells with cells that do not work properly and they may kill
normal cells.
Nanotechnology offers a wealth of tools that are providing cancer
researchers with new and innovative ways to diagnose and treat cancer.
Already, nanotechnology has been used to create new and improved ways
to find small tumors through imaging. Nanoscale drug delivery devices

are being developed to deliver anticancer therapeutics specifically to
tumors.
Nanotechnology provides opportunities to prevent cancer progression. For example, nanoscale systems, because of their small dimensions,
could be applied to stop progression of certain types of breast cancers.
Examples of nanotechnology in cancer research today include the
following:
r Nanoscale cantilevers and nanowire sensors that can detect a cancer from
a single cell.
r Nanoparticles can aid in imaging malignant lesions, so surgeons know
where the cancer is, and how to remove it.
r Nanoshells can kill tumor cells selectively, so patients do not suffer terrible
side effects from healthy cells being destroyed.
r Dendrimers can sequester drugs to reduce side effects and deliver multiple drugs to maximize therapeutic impact.
Cancer and Nanoshells

Nanoshells are hollow silica spheres covered with gold. Scientists can
attach antibodies to their surfaces, enabling the shells to target certain cells, such as cancer cells. In mouse tests, Professor Naomi Halas’s
research team at Rice University directed infrared radiation through
tissue and onto the shells, causing the gold to superheat and destroy
tumor cells while leaving healthy ones intact. Technicians can control
the amount of heat with the thickness of the gold and the kind of laser.
Nanoshells could one day also be filled with drug-containing polymers.
Heating them would cause the polymers to release a controlled amount
of the drug. Human trials using gold nanoshells are slated to begin in a
couple of years.

Cancer and Gold Nanoparticles

Oral cancer is any cancerous tissue growth located in the mouth.
Smoking and other tobacco use are associated with 70 percent to 80 percent of oral cancer cases. Thirty thousand Americans will be diagnosed
with oral or pharyngeal cancer this year. It will cause over 8,000 deaths,
killing roughly 1 person per hour, 24 hours per day.
One oral cancer research group has demonstrated that gold nanoparticles can be bond to malignant cells making cancer easier to diagnose and treat. In laboratory demonstrations, the researchers targeted

Breast Cancer and Nanoparticles



Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United
States, with approximately 180,000 new cases diagnosed in this country
annually. Breast cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death
(after lung cancer and colon cancer) in the United States.
Statistics show that a woman has a one in eight chance of developing
breast cancer during her life. In 2007, breast cancer is expected to cause
approximately 40,000 deaths.

ing antibodies, are concealed in polymers. The polymers make the antibodies nearly invisible
to the body’s immune system.
The reason for the polymer coating is that you do not want the antibodies to be attacked by the immune system. Inside the bloodstream,
the antibodies go to work and attach themselves onto the surface of
tumor cells. Then, outside the body, laboratory technicians apply a heat
source to the magnetic particles in the tumor region of the body. By
applying just the right amount of heat to the tumor region, the heated
magnetic particles weaken and destroy the cancer cells.
Please note the use of magnetic particles as a heat treatment to kill
breast cancer cells in humans is still conducted only in laboratories at
the preclinical and developmental stage. Preclinical tests for humans
are still in the future, maybe 5 to 10 years from now.

numbers.
How did you get involved in breast cancer research?

One of your research projects is to continue to collect and evaluate
data to demonstrate that adding an anti-HER2 agent (Herceptin) to
chemotherapy patients with HER2 positive breast cancer can help
prevent recurrence of breast cancer in patients.
What is HER2?
HER2 is a protein found on the membrane (with a portion in the surface) of cells that helps regulate cell growth. However, when the amount
and type of HER2 protein are altered, this leads to increased cell growth
and possibility of cancer spread, as a result of increased breast cancer
aggressiveness.
How does the anti-HER2 agent (Herceptin) treatment work?
Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. This treatment is used for metastatic breast
cancer, but also to diminish the risk of tumor reappearance (and improve survival) after breast cancer surgery. Metastatic, describes a cancer
that has spread to distant organs from the original tumor site. Metastatic
breast cancer is the most advanced stage of breast cancer. Herceptin
slows the growth and spread of tumors that have an overabundance of
HER2.
What advice would you give young people who want to explore a career
in the medical field and in cancer research?
The medical field, and specifically cancer research, is a great career.
There are a lot of facets to be involved with including case and clinical
research, patient care, and education. Additionally, the strength of the
science and the advances being made and in the horizon makes it an
important career for helping society. It is truly an engaging and fulfilling
career, both intellectually and on a personal level.

Cancer and Dendrimers

As you learned in Chapter 2, a dendrimer is a tree-like highly branched
polymer molecule. Dendrimers are of particular interest for cancer applications because of their defined and reproducible size, but more
importantly, because it is easy to attach a variety of other molecules
to the surface of a dendrimer. Such molecules could include antibodies, imaging agents to pinpoint tumors, drug molecules for delivery

to a tumor, and molecules that might detect if an anticancer drug is
working.
Cancer and Cantilevers

In Chapter 3, you read about the cantilevers attached to the scanning probe microscopes. The cantilever is one tool with potential to aid
in cancer diagnosis. Nanoscale cantilevers, tiny bars anchored at one
end, can be engineered to bind to molecules associated with cancer.
They may bind to altered DNA sequences or proteins that are present in
certain types of cancer. When the cancer-associated molecules bind to
the cantilevers, there are changes in surface tension that cause the cantilevers to bend. By monitoring whether or not the cantilevers are bent,
scientists can tell whether the cancer molecules are present. Scientists
hope this bending will be evident even when the altered molecules are
present in very low concentrations. This will be useful in detecting early
molecular events in the development of cancer.
Cancer and Quantum Dots

Quantum dots also show promises of a new means of diagnosing
and combating cancer. Quantum dots, also known as nanocrystals, are
miniscule particles, or “dots” made of semiconducting materials. When
the dots are stimulated by ultraviolet light, they glow in very intense,
bright neon colors.
Emory University scientists have used luminescent quantum dot nanoparticles in living animals to target and image cancerous tumors. The
quantum dots were first coated with a protective shell covering. Then
special antibodies were attached to the surface of the quantum dots.
After the quantum dots were injected into the body, they were guided to
a prostate tumor of living mice. Using a mercury lamp, the scientists were
able to see the surface of the tumor. It was illuminated by the accumulation of quantum dots on the cell. The scientists believe the ability to both
target and image cells in vivo (in the body) represents an important step
in the goal to eventually use nanotechnology to target, image, and treat
cancer, cardiovascular plaques, and other diseases in humans.
Cervical Cancer and Quantum Dots

Each year, some 10,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer,
and over 35 percent will die because their cancer was detected too
late for treatment to be successful. Easier methods of routinely screening women for precancerous lesions could favor a better survival rate.

Research published in a gynecology journal suggests that the application of quantum dots with other tools, could provide a method for early
detection of cervical cancer.
The Targeted Nano-TherapeuticsTM (TNTTM ) System

The TNTTM System is a noninvasive product that kills cancer using
localized lethal heat with negligible damage to healthy tissues. The product is being developed by the Triton Biosystems company and has begun human clinical trials. A component referred to as T-probes are
dispensed into the body in serum form by an infusion into the patient’s
blood stream. Once the T-probes are attached to cancer cells, a focused
magnetic field selectively activates the magnetic spheres.
The magnetic energy in the spheres is converted to lethal heat which
causes a rapid temperature increase at the surface of the cancer cells,
killing them with negligible damage to surrounding healthy tissues.
Over a couple of weeks following the infusion, the T-probes completely
degrade within the body with no trace or toxicity. The Company believes
the TNTTM System will eliminate many of the side effects currently
associated with conventional therapies.
DIABETES AND NANOTECHNOLOGY

Glucose is the primary source of energy in the human body. This
simple sugar comes from digesting carbohydrates into a chemical that
the human body can easily convert to energy. But, when glucose levels
in the bloodstream are not properly regulated, a person can develop
a serious condition known as diabetes. What happens is that the sugar
(glucose) builds up in the blood instead of going to the cells.
The American Diabetes Association estimates that 17 million people
in the United States have diabetes, but that one-third are unaware they
have the disease. “Diabetes,” says the American Diabetes Association, “is
a chronic disease that has no cure.”

To control their glucose levels, patients with diabetes must take small
blood samples many times a day. Such procedures are uncomfortable

and extremely inconvenient. Then, if their glucose level is low, the patient can inject insulin, a hormone that regulates the level of glucose.
This is done everyday, with no days off.
Many scientists and researchers are working on ways to solve the
diabetes riddle. So a cure, perhaps, is on the way.
Nanorobots and Diabetes

One research group is developing the potential of using nanorobots
for treating diabetes. The nanorobots use embedded nanobiosensors in
the body to monitor blood glucose levels. The special sensors provide
signals to mobile phones carried with the patient. If the glucose level
is too low, the nanorobots activate a programmed tune in the cellular
phone. The tune alerts the patient to take any necessary action regarding the diabetes. This potential use of the nanorobots may be more
convenient and safe for data collection and patient monitoring.
Biosensors for Diabetes



Monitoring blood glucose levels can be tiresome, even with today’s
improved monitoring devices. Drs. Makarand Paranjape and John Currie, researchers in the Georgetown Advanced Electronics Laboratory
(GAEL), are working to take the process to a whole new level.
For the past few years, the team has been developing and testing a
new biosensor device for blood glucose monitoring. The biosensor, the
size of a small band-aid is designed to be worn anywhere

skin. The device is small and
convenient, and makes measuring glucose levels pain-free and noninvasive. Professor Paranjape and researchers at Georgetown University also
have a video showing the procedure called Monitoring Blood Glucose
without Pain or Blood.
See Chapter 7 to read an interview with Professor Paranjape discussing
biosensors.
Diabetes Research Continues

Other groups are also developing new tools to treat diabetes. In
one study, researchers were able to bond insulin molecules and sugarsensitive proteins to a biodegradable polymer. The polymer nanoparticles are injected into a repository under the skin. The nanoparticles

can detect a diabetic’s glucose levels and release appropriate amounts
of insulin to keep blood sugar levels steady. The research indicates that
diabetics could administer the treatment with only one daily injection,
rather than the several pinprick glucose tests and then followed up with
insulin shots. An injection a day is all that will be needed. No blood
testing. No multiple injections.
Tattoos for Diabetes

Scientists are developing a smart tattoo that could tell diabetics when
their glucose levels are dangerously low. Once perfected, the tattoo will
allow glucose levels to be monitored around the clock, and could warn
the patient if their glucose levels are too low.
The tattoo has been designed by Professors Gerard Cote, of Texas
A&M University, and Michael Pishko, of the chemical engineering department at Penn State University. The tattoo is made of polyethylene
glycol beads that are coated with fluorescent molecules. The polymer
molecules are injected underneath the skin using a needle. Under a

tion of glucose in the bloodstream.
In other words, the fluorescence levels change according to the
amount of glucose present. As an example, a low glucose level would
emit a different fluorescent light than a satisfactory glucose level. The
fluorescence levels could be measured using a device, such as a watchlike monitor.
IMPLANTS AND PROSTHETICS

In the coming years, patients may receive hip implants and other
bone implants that employ nanotechnology. As an example, one
research group has created a microsensor for patients recovering from
hip replacement and other joint related surgery.
The nanotechnology sensor is permanently implanted with the joint
implant. The self-powered wireless microsensor monitors the bone healing process after surgery. During the healing process, the device measures and compares how the bone grows and attaches to the pores on

the surface of the implant. It records how the patient is healing and
when the patient can resume normal activities.
This technology will not only monitor bone healing at the time of
surgery but also can determine when implants are worn out and need to
be replaced. The average lifetime of implants is about 15 years. Therefore the microsensor will be valuable throughout the patient’s lifetime
for observing and maintaining the health of the implant.
NANOTECHNOLOGY AND BURN VICTIMS

Each year, some 45,000 people are hospitalized with burns in the
United States. Researchers in the College of Textiles at NC State are
creating unconventional “textile” products, such as skin grafts, by harnessing the power of nanotechnology. Russell Gorga, assistant professor
in Textile Engineering, Chemistry, and Science at North Carolina State,
has been using nanofibers to build a synthetic copy of the body’s connective tissue that surrounds and supports cells. The nanofiber skin grafts
can be used to regrow the skin of burn or laceration victims. The skin
graft provides a porous support structure where cells can attach and
nutrients can flow into the cell while waste flows away.
The antibiotic properties of silver have made the metal a popular
treatment for wounds and burns. Silver helps skin to heal by preventing infections. In recent years several companies have revolutionized
wound care with silver-impregnated dressings that require fewer painful
changings.
Another research team has modified using old model inkjet printers
to develop a way to make sheets of human skin to be used on burn victims. The printer cartridges are filled with living cells. The printer sprays
cell materials, rather than ink, onto a gauze material, creating a sheet
of living tissue. The researchers hope that this “skin-printing” method
will minimize rejections by the body. This could be a life-saving technology for the 20 percent of burn patients who have the most extensive
burns.
DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY

The main advantage of nanomedicine is to get earlier diagnosis of
a disease. Diagnosing a disease early leads to less severe and costly
therapeutic demands and an improved clinical care. But the human
body is a dark place to observe. So, you need special instruments that
can cut through the darkness and provide a window into the body.
These kinds of instruments are called imaging tools and you may

be familiar with some of them. They include ultrasound, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron emission tomography (PET).
These instruments allow scientists to see more on everything from observation of individual molecules and their movement within cells.
Molecular Imaging Diagnosis

Nanotechnology can help in designing the next generation of molecular imaging instruments for use in early diagnosis of a disease. The
instruments can make it possible to track the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, treat disease, and monitor the response to therapies. Not only
can molecular imaging be used to find, diagnose, and treat disease inside the body, but will also have the ability to show how well a particular
treatment is working. As an example, molecular imaging has the potential to suggest how quickly a cancer is growing by determining how
rapidly cancer cells are growing and how many are or are not dying.
Once this assessment is made, physicians can compile data to determine how best to treat patients with cancers growing at specific rates.
Molecular imaging may someday allow discovery of a predisease state in
patients.
Lab-on-a-Chip Diagnosis

Laboratory-on-a-chip technology for earlier and quicker diagnosis of
a disease is being developed. Lab-on-a-chip has become possible because
nanotechnology lets scientists manipulate extremely small materials, on
the scale of atoms and molecules. The lab-on-a-chip is a miniaturized,
portable version of a blood-count machine. The lab-on-a- chip can be
designed for many applications. One example is that it could be a diagnostic tool for cancer detection by searching in blood plasma for certain
molecules that could be early indicators of the disease. The handheld
device also has advantages since it requires only a little sample of blood
to analyze the blood chemistry of a patient. Analyzing the composition of
blood is how doctors test for infections and deficiencies in the immune
system.
DRUG DELIVERY USING NANOPARTICLES

Researchers believe that the potential benefits of nanotechnology will
be to provide vast improvements in drug delivery and drug targeting
techniques. These new strategies are often called drug delivery systems
(DDS). The goal of a drug delivery system is to deliver the medications
to a specific part of the body and to control the time-release rate of the

medication. The drug delivery systems will minimize drug degradation
and loss and prevent harmful side effects by delivering therapeutic drugs
to the desired site of the body. Drug delivery systems will have potential
for many applications, including antitumor therapy, gene therapy, AIDS
therapy, and the delivery of antibiotics and vaccines.
Advanced Drug Delivery Systems and Lab-on-a-Chip

Some researchers have discussed the possibility of combining the
laboratory-on-a-chip and the drug delivery system. A small device would
be implanted into the body, which would continuously monitor the
various biochemicals in the bloodstream and in response to an injury
or disease would release appropriate drugs. For example, an insulindependent diabetic could use such a device to continuously monitor his
glucose levels and release insulin into the bloodstream, if needed.

NANOTECHNOLOGY FIGHTS INFECTIONS

Several companies are researching and experimenting with silver
nanoparticles that may prevent infections by killing organisms such as
Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and other kinds of infectious bacteria and
viruses. In their research laboratories, the companies are using silver
(colloidal or ionic silver) or silver in solution as a potent antibacterial
product.
Silver is used as an enhancement in making bandages, dressings,
and other health-care products. The silver nanoparticles or nanocrystals kill bacteria, viruses, and germs. The technicians break down silver
into nanoparticles that are much smaller than naturally occurring particles. This process creates greater solubility and an improved ability
for the silver atoms to migrate through a germ’s cell walls to kill the
organism.
The antibacterial and antiviral properties of silver are found in the
products of other industries as well. One shoe manufacturer is using
silver fiber built into shoes to prevent foot fungus and bacteria from
growing. This is important to diabetics, as they are prone to serious foot
infections such as gangrene, which can result in amputation of the foot
or limb if infection is allowed to set in.
Several manufacturers of outdoor equipment are also using silver
fiber in their products to prevent bacteria and fungi from growing in
their sleeping bags, cold-weather jackets, hiking clothes, and cycling
jerseys.
PHARMACEUTICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH

The National Science Foundation (NSF) expects nanotechnology to
account for around half of all drugs made and sold by 2010. Demand for
nanotechnology health-care products in the United States is projected
to increase nearly 50 percent per year to $6.5 billion in 2009. There
will be the potential of introducing new, improved cancer and central
nervous system therapies. Diagnostic tests, based on quantum dots and
imaging agents based on iron oxide nanoparticles will also show strong
growth, according to pharmaceutical economists. By 2020, demand
for nanotechnology health-care products is projected to exceed $100
billion.
The need for new or improved medicines in several therapeutic areas
will lead to the increasing use of nanotechnology in pharmaceutical
applications. These areas include protein-based compounds for cancer,
diabetes, and for infectious diseases. Experts also predict that over the

What is the Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision Awards Program?
Before we proceed to the interview, Patricia Palazzolo was kind enough
to fill me in on the steps that are needed to submit a project for the
Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision Awards Program. These are her words:
“The students are asked to produce an 11-page paper and a 5-page
design for a related Web site based on their ideas for the future of
any current technology or technological item. They do a tremendous
amount of research to learn about the beginnings and cutting-edge of
the technological item. They then use their creative and critical thinking skills to imagine what that item might be like 20 years from now,
what breakthroughs would be necessary to turn their futuristic idea into
reality, and what the ramifications—both positive and negative—would
be if their idea were to become reality. There are no three-dimensional
models required for the initial submission, although students reaching the higher levels of the competition are required to create a visual
representation of a prototype of their invention.”

chance to sit down with Matt and Sarah and ask them a few questions.
What was the inspiration for NAI?
Matt: At the time we were beginning the project, bird flu was a concern
for many people of the world. We decided to try and come up with a way
to eliminate the fear of the virus.
Sarah: However, we did not want to make our invention limited to a
certain time period or a certain ailment. We then broadened our look
and came up with NAI.
Before you could invent NAI, you had to research current
immunization methods. What are some?
Sarah: The main precursor to NAI is the vaccine. The traditional shotbased vaccine is the main method of immunization in our world today,
but scientists are coming up with new methods including mist and cream
vaccines.

What exactly is NAI?
Matt: NAI: Nanotech Active Immunization is a plan to successfully immunize the masses without the dangerous side effects of needle-based
vaccinations. NAI uses nanotech robots called GNATs (Gargantuan Nanotech Antigen-removal Team) to enter the body and destroy the viral
genetic material using enzymes.
How are the GNAT robots structured?
Sarah: The GNAT robot is a tiny, self-controlled robot. The robots are
airborne, and are inhaled into the body. These robots float around in the
bloodstream until a virus is detected, whereupon the robots are activated
and destroy the virus. Each GNAT robot is powered by thousands of
muscle cells growing on the silicon chips. The cells are very much alive,
and produce ATP during aerobic respiration, which powers them.
How do the GNAT robots eliminate viral infection?
Matt: Each GNAT robot has sensors that detect the protein capsid, a
component of all viruses. Once detected, the robot rushes to the virus,
where it inserts a long needle into the nuclear matrix. DNase and RNase
enzymes, made by pancreatic cells on the robot, travel through the
needle and break down the genetic material in the virus. Without any
genetic material, the virus cannot infect the person. White blood cells
destroy the “empty” virus, and the robot goes into StandBy mode until
another virus is detected.
What are some anticipated benefits or risks to using NAI?
Sarah: Well, the benefits of NAI are obvious. No one would get infected
by viruses anymore. This would remove the threats of thousands of
different viruses, from the common cold to HIV.
Matt: However, NAI, as with all medications, may have its risks. Since
we haven’t really made it, we can’t say what risks it may have, but we can
put out some guesses. Since the GNAT robots are located in the air, the
robots may affect children or animals differently than adults. Also, there
is always the possibility of a technology malfunction.
Are there any institutions that are currently using nanotechnology in a
similar way that you propose to use it in NAI?
Sarah: NAI is a completely theoretical project, but modern science is
well on its way to making it a reality. A needle-free, nanotechnologybased vaccine has been developed for anthrax. In addition, similar nanotechnology-based vaccines have been developed for bubonic
plague, staph, and ricin for the U.S. Army, as well as one for malaria for
the U.S. Navy.

The Business of
Nanotechnology
NANOTECHNOLOGIES IN BUSINESSES

The National Science Foundation predicts that the global marketplace
for goods and services using nanotechnologies will grow to $1 trillion
by 2015. The United States invests approximately $3 billion annually
in nanotechnology research and development. This dollar figure accounts for approximately one-third of the total public and private sector
investments worldwide.
The range of possibilities of nanotechnology-manufactured
products—from electronics to communications, aerospace, medicine,
energy, construction, and consumer goods—is almost limitless. More
than one-half of the major corporations that are in the stock market
are in the nanotechnology business now or will be in the future. See
the Appendix for a listing of companies that are in the nanotechnology
field.
Last year, more than $32 billion in products with nanotech materials
were sold worldwide. By 2014, some $2.6 trillion in manufactured goods
could contain nanotechnologies, according to a research group that
tracks the industry.
The researchers also estimated that about a little over 1,000 companies
have claimed to be working in a field that is related in some way to
nanotechnology. In addition, the researchers also indicated that there
are 1,500 companies that are exploring nanotechnology options.
SPORTING GOODS EQUIPMENT

The sporting goods companies have been adapting nanotechnology
for several years. In fact, they may have been the earliest of commercial companies to use nanotechnology applications. As an example,

some hockey equipment manufacturers have developed carbon nanotube composite hockey sticks that are more durable and have better
impact resistance than traditional sticks.
Baseball Bats

One sports manufacturer has created a special bat they call the CNT.
The “CNT” stands for carbon nanotube technology. In their traditional
carbon fiber bats, the spaces inside contain only resin. Over time the
resin can weaken the bat’s power. The company solved the problem by
applying a special carbon nanotube solution into the resin. The result
is that the bat gives hitters more power through the hitting zone. These
new bats can cost about $175 and up.
Tennis Rackets

New kinds of nanotech tennis rackets are now in sporting goods retail
stores around the world. One of the latest tennis racket features a small
proportion of nanotubes that are located in the yoke of the racket. This
is the part of the racket that tends to bend slightly with the impact of a
hard-hitting tennis ball. According to tests, the nano tennis rackets bend
less during ball impact than the traditional rackets. The rackets, which
weigh 245 to 255 grams cost about $230.
Nano Golf Balls



Wilson announced it was the first golf equipment manufacturer to
strategically use nanotechnology. The application of the cutting-edge
technology has allowed Wilson Sporting Goods Company to develop
stronger and lighter materials that optimize the performance of their
lineup of sporting goods equipment.
Not to be left out, other golf equipment companies have also figured
out how to alter the materials in a golf ball at the molecular level so the
weight inside shifts less as the
ball spins. This means that

according to the manufacturer.
Skis and Nanofibers

Every skier wants to improve his or her performance on the slopes.
Ordinary skis may have tiny voids that create stress points that weaken
the ski. One company now injects nanoparticle crystals into these voids.

clubs, and making lighter racing bikes and Indianapolis racing sport
cars.

CHEWING GUM AND NANOCRYSTALS

Did you ever wonder why there is no chocolate chewing gum? One
reason is that the cocoa butter in the chocolate could not mix well with
the polymers, the chemicals that give gum its elasticity. In fact, the fats
found in chocolate will cause chewing gum to fall apart. A Chicago-based
company, called O’Lala’s, developed a solution incorporating nanoscale
crystals. The crystals give its gum a creamier texture and chocolate flavor.
A pack of 12 pieces will cost you about $1.25.

APPAREL INDUSTRY

Several clothing companies have come out with a new brand of nonstain fabric for pants that uses nanotechnology. The fabric resists spills
from many types of fibers such as cotton, synthetics, wool, silk, rayon,
and polypropylene. The nanomade fabric also repels a range of liquids
including beverages and salad dressings. The fabric keeps the body cool
and comfortable and has an antistatic treatment that reduces static cling
from dog hair, lint, and dust.
Nanotechnology in Cleaner Clothes



David Soane, a chemical engineer, started a company called NanoTex. He uses the principles of nanotechnology to improve the strength
and durability of natural fibers like cotton. He created tiny structures
that he calls “nanowhiskers,” which are tiny hairs that make liquid spills
bead up and roll right off various fabrics.
Soane discovered his idea for nanowhiskers by washing a peach, a
fuzzy kind of fruit. “When you wash a peach, very often the water
rolls right off,” explains
Soane. “That’s because on the

these little pointed whiskers.”
sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?article
The nanowhiskers can repel
id=218392126&language=english
stains because they form a
cushion of air around each cotton fiber. When something is spilled
on the surface of the fabric, “the miniature whiskers actually prop up
the liquid drops, allowing the liquid drops to roll off,” says Soane, who
calls his stainproofing process, Nano-Care.
Each of Soane’s synthetic nanowhiskers is only 10 nanometers long,
made of only a few atoms of carbon. “They repel a range of fluids,” says
Soane, “including coffee, tea, salad oil, ketchup, soy sauce, cranberry
juice.”
Nanotechnology Socks

Another nano-improved apparel application that is selling in United
States Military Stores, stateside and abroad, are specially-made polyester
socks. The company ARC Outdoors uses a special process that allows
nanometer silver particles to bond within the fibers of the sock. The
silver has antimicrobial properties that provide protection against odor
and fungus in socks.

COSMETICS

Several cosmetic companies have already marketed a number of products that include nanotechnology applications. These products include:
deodorants, antiaging creams, and sunscreens.
Sunscreens and Skin Cancer

Skin cancers are caused by abnormal cell changes in the outer layer
of skin called the epidermis. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in
the world. Most cases of skin cancer can be cured, but the disease is a
major health problem because it affects so many people.
Excessive exposure to sunlight is the main cause of skin cancer. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) rays that can alter the genetic material in
skin cells causing mutations.
Doctors believe that if you are at risk for skin cancer, you should
follow certain precautions that include avoiding intense sun exposure
from late morning through early afternoon. While outdoors, wear a hat,
long sleeves, trousers, and sunglasses that block UV radiation. Another
precaution tip is to use a sunscreen, a sun blocker, with a sun protection
factor of 15 or higher whenever you are outside.
Zinc is one of the most effective sun blockers used in sunscreens
because they can absorb much of the harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that
can damage human skin.
However, because of the

make the zinc particles small
enough, the sunscreen will appear transparent because it will let visible
light pass through.
So, researchers at the cosmetic companies went to work to reduce
the large zinc particles into ultrafine nanoparticles. Their reduction of
the size of the zinc particles is impressive. The large zinc oxide particles
were reduced from about 250 nanometers to as tiny as 10 nanometers.
These ultra fine nanoparticles are especially effective in absorbing
light in the damaging ultraviolet range, below 400 nanometers wavelength. The evidence so far is that a sunscreen containing an equivalent

Nano Silver Seal Refrigerator

One major kitchen appliance company has offered a new line of
refrigerators and washing machines that uses nanocoatings to prevent
germs and molds from growing inside the appliances. Silver, as small as
1 nanometer across, is used to coat surfaces. These nanoparticles are
so electrically active that they inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria
and fungus. In a refrigerator, one company used the nanosilver in the

that passes over them.
[Note. The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating to find if
silver particles can be harmful when they are applied in the manufacturing of some appliances.]
Flat-Plane Display Screens

Since 2003 several large electronic companies began producing the
latest flat-screen display technology for laptops, cell phones, digital cameras, and other uses that are made of nanostructured polymer films.
These special displays are known as OLEDs, or organic light-emitting
diodes.
These ultrathin displays are manufactured by sandwiching extremely
thin (often nano-sized) layers of organic polymer light-emitting materials between electrodes. The images are bright and viewable at wideangles. The displays are smaller and lighter-weight than traditional LCD
displays—meaning they are ideally suited to mobile electronics, such
as digital cameras, cellular phones, and handheld computers. Among
OLED screen advantages are brighter images, lighter weight, less power
consumption, and wider viewing angles.
The Business of Air Purifiers

Everyone wants clean air indoors. In fact, indoor pollution may be
more of a problem in many areas than outdoor air pollution. So companies are building better indoor air purifiers. One company, NanoTwin
Technologies, has patented NanoTube as the active component behind
their NanoBreeze Air Purifier. The tube is wrapped in a fiberglass mesh
coated by a layer of titanium dioxide crystals that measure 40 nanometers in size. When switched on, the NanoTube radiates UV light that
charges the crystals to create powerful oxidizing agents that destroy
airborne germs and pollutants circulating over the tube’s surface.
ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTERS

The best computer chips used presently can hold around 40 million transistors, each measuring around a micrometer (one-thousandth
of a millimeter) or less. This is electronics on a microscale, and it
is done using what is called a top-down approach. It involves taking
material, usually silicon, and slicing it up into many wafers. Patterns
(circuits consisting of many transistors) are drawn on light-sensitive
films on the surface of each wafer. Using a light source, the unwanted
material between the circuits is etched away with acid. The result is

a finished product. This manufacturing approach is called top down
because you start with something large, and then cut it down to a
product you want. Most traditional chip manufacturers use top-down
processes.
However, nanotechnology researchers are also looking at another
completely new way of manufacturing transistors. The new way requires
a bottom-up approach. In this process, molecules are created on the
surface of a chip allowing the molecules to self-assemble into larger
structures used to make transistors.
AUTOMOBILE/VEHICLE INDUSTRY

Nanomaterials could make future automobiles and airplanes lighter
and stronger and most of all improve fuel efficiency. Nanotechnology
promises to make everything from new coatings that are scratch-resistant
and self-cleaning to batteries that last longer for hybrid vehicles. In the
longer term, nanotechnology applications will most likely make hydrogen easier to produce and safer to store as a renewable energy source for
vehicles. Most experts agree that nanotechnology will play an important
role in advancing hydrogen fuel cell technology. See Chapter 8 for more
information about hydrogen fuel cells.
Auto Catalytic Converters

Automakers are developing new ways to improve on their catalytic
converters that are used to control automobile emissions.
Today conventional technologies utilize precious group metals called
PGMs. The PGMs, such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, are the
main catalysts used in catalytic converters to control automobile emissions. However, the PGM demand has resulted in higher platinum
prices. Also, the need for more PGMs is expected to continue to rise
with
r an increase of more diesel cars in Europe,
r higher emission standards for trucks in North America and Japan, and

r an increase of vehicle production and higher emission standards in China
and India.

Several nanofabrication companies are now developing nanocomposites catalysts that will use much lower levels of PGMs in catalytic
converters.

Automobile Paint and Waxes

A new type of finish for automobile bodies offers improved scratch
resistance compared to conventional paint finishes. The nanoparticle
clear coat lacquer fills in and conceals scratches, which provides a nice
glossy coat to the look of the car or truck.
Several nano car waxes are now on the market and they are made
with nano-sized polishing agents. The new waxes provide a better
shine due to its ability to fill-in tiny blemishes in automotive paint
finishes.
The automobile companies are also spending money on nanotechnology to manufacture better-built vehicles to make them lighter, stronger,
safer, and more fuel-efficient. For strength and safety, they are using
nanocomposites in the frames, doors, engines, seats, tires, and in other
auto parts as well. They are experimenting and testing hydrogen fuel
cells to power their vehicles, making them less dependent on petroleumbased fuels and better for the environment.
Aeronautic companies are researching ways to use nanosensors that
could be built directly into the body of an aircraft and used to identify
mechanical, structural, and electrical problems before they ever arise.
Among the more innovative things nanotechnologists envision are selfhealing materials and shape-shifting wings.

AIRCRAFT POTENTIAL AND METAL RUBBER

In Chapter 2, you read about Dr. Claus, the President of NanoSonic
Inc. that makes Metal RubberTM . As you recall, Metal RubberTM looks
like brown plastic wrap and has some amazing properties, including
elasticity and it is very tough. Dr. Claus said that one of the most exciting applications of Metal RubberTM is to use it for “morphing aircraft
structures. These are aircraft that dynamically change the shape of their
wings and their control surfaces during flight,” he explains. Almost the
way that a hawk might fly along, see prey, and change its shape to dive
down. The hawk changes the shape of its body, and when it does that, it
needs to be able to sense what the outside forces and pressures are so it
knows how to fly. For a plane, you need a material that’s mechanically
flexible. But you also need a material with a surface that’s controlled
by sensors and electrical conductors that allow it to do that sensing
and change shape accordingly. Metal RubberTM might allow sensors
that can be flexed. Now NanoSonic is working in partnership with an
aircraft company to explore Metal RubberTM potential in aerospace.
PAINT AND OTHER WATER RESISTANCE COATINGS

Another example of rapid growth in nanotechnology applications is in
the field of wear-resistant paints and other kinds of coatings. Beginning
in 1996, the Department of Defense (DOD) supported funding for
developing processes to manufacture coatings for use in the marine
environment.
Then in 2000, the first nanostructured coating was qualified for use
on gears of air-conditioning units for U.S. Navy ships. DOD estimates
that use of the coatings on this equipment will result in a $20 million
reduction in maintenance costs over 10 years. The development of wearresistant coatings by the DOD will lead to commercial applications that
can extend the lifetime of moving parts in everything from personal cars
to heavy industrial machinery.
Paints and Anti-Graffiti Coating

Graffiti is an expensive social concern for many major cities. Two
examples illustrate the scale of the problem: the subway system or the
tube in London spends over 15 million dollars per year for cleaning
up graffiti and the City of Los Angeles spends even more millions for
cleanup work.
Several companies have used nanotechnology to create paints and
coatings to help solve the graffiti problem. Some of the products, so

far being developed, provide a permanent clear coating that does not
allow paint, permanent markers, stickers, graffiti, or any other markings
to bond to the coating. The clear coating forms a barrier between the
surface of, say, a wall and any graffiti paint that might be applied.
REMOVING WINDSHIELD FOG

Fog conditions can be a major concern for drivers in many parts of the
world. Many vehicle accidents have occurred due to fogging conditions
that have occurred rapidly. One company may have an answer to keep
the fog particles from forming on the windshields of cars and trucks.
They are developing a way to heat up a windshield without the use
of costly copper heating elements. The group has designed a special
coating, consisting of a transparent coat of carbon nanotubes (CNT),
to cover the surface of a windshield. When electricity is supplied to the
windshield, it becomes a heater that can clear the surface of a windshield
in a short period of time.
SELF-CLEANING GLASS

Tired of cleaning windows? After years of development, Pilkington
ActivTM is the world’s first self-cleaning glass to use a microscopic coating
with a unique dual action. The coating on the glass reacts with ultraviolet
light given off by the sun. This reaction on the surface breaks down and
loosens the organic dirt. Then, when it rains, the coating causes rain
water to “sheet” off the surface of the glass, which not only washes
away the loosened particles of dirt, but also prevents the formulation of
droplets, which cause streaks and make windows look dirty.
ANTIBACTERIAL CLEANSERS

There are several antibacterial cleansers that use nanoemulsion technology to kill pathogens. These cleansers are able to kill tuberculosis
and bacteria while remaining nonflammable, noncorrosive, and nontoxic. The good news is that there are no harmful effects when using
these products.
MEDICAL BANDAGES

Silver’s antibiotic properties have made the metal a popular treatment
for wounds and burns. Special dressings for burns offer antimicrobial
barrier protection using concentrations of silver with nanocrystalline
technology. It helps skin to heal by preventing infections during treatment. The silver-impregnated dressings require fewer painful changings
than previous silver treatments.

SOLAR ENERGY: PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS

In this century, the use of solar cells is a major goal for supplying
energy needs for the United States as well as the world. As of 2005,
the world market for solar cells was about 3 to 4 billion dollars. Of
this amount Japan had a 20 percent share, according to economic
experts. Germany had the greatest number of solar installations, accounting for 57 percent. The United States accounts for 7 percent
and Europe accounts for 6 percent. The rest of the world accounts for
10 percent.
Many companies are focusing on the technology in the production
of solar cells. However, the technology still remains expensive when
compared to the costs of fossil fuels. Presently solar cells have two major
problems: they cost too much to make (in the form of energy), and they
are not very efficient. Typical efficiencies for solar cells range from 10
to 15 percent.
Scientists have been doing a lot of research and experiments with
quantum dots to make photovoltaic cells more efficient. A new quantumdot-based solar cell has recently been prototyped with 30 percent efficiency.
One company, Nanosolar, has developed a low-cost technology to
make solar cells based on the economics of printing. Their technology

The technology of producing thin-film solar cells has the potential
to achieve mass production at low costs. One economic researcher estimates that the market for thin-film solar cells will increase in the next
few years, and then reach $1.5 billion in sales in 2012. See Chapter 8 for

BATTERY TECHNOLOGY

Lithium-ion batteries, commonly used in laptops and cell phones,
have a relatively short life span because they use a graphite anode,
which wears out quickly with normal usage. Altair Nanotechnologies
has developed nanomaterials that resulted in safer, more powerful
batteries.
The Altair team substituted the carbon anode with lithium titanate
(LiTiO) nanocrystals, which makes the battery last longer. Lithium

Using the lithium titanate

nanocrystals also lengthened the life of a lithium-ion battery from 750 recharges to between
10,000 and 15,000 recharges. The nanocrystals also made the battery
safer.
Virus-Assembled Batteries

Professor Angela Belcher, a biomolecular materials chemist at MIT, is
trying to use biological methods, such as viruses, to assemble batteries.
“The goal is to have biology make things in an environmentally friendly
way,” says Professor Belcher.
Professor Belcher’s virus-assembled batteries are thin, transparent
sheets that look like plastic wrap. They could be used to create smart
credit cards or lightweight hearing-aid batteries. Eventually, Professor
Belcher hopes to weave battery cells into textile fibers to create batterypowered fabrics for clothing. As an example, soldiers might plug nightvision goggles into their uniforms, instead of using traditional batteries
for energy.
Long-Lasting Batteries

The company mPhase Technologies and Bell Labs, research and development part of Lucent Technologies, have teamed up to develop a
type of nanobattery. The nanobattery can store and generate electric
current that could be used for many years after it is bought.
In traditional batteries, all the chemicals are mixed together in the
battery. This causes traditional batteries to degrade even when not in
use. Therefore, traditional batteries have a certain shelf life before they

expire. In the new nanobattery, the chemicals are not mixed together,
until you activate it. In other words, no power is used until the device,
such as a tool, is turned on. So, the battery does not dissipate any of its
chemical energy when not in use. This feature provides a very, very long
shelf life that regular batteries don’t have.
THE BUSINESS OF BUILDING ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPES

Several companies such as Asylum Research, Veeco, Agilent, Novascan
specialize in sales and services of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The
AFM is a high-resolution imaging and measurement tool that allows
researchers to directly view single atoms or molecules that are only a few
nanometers in size. Then it produces a three-dimensional map of the
sample’s surface.
Atomic force microscopes are a significant portion of the $1 billion
market for nanotechnology measurement tools. The price of an AFM
can cost up to $500,000.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the principal technology that scientists and researchers use to view and manipulate samples at the nanometer scale, which is why it’s called the “eyes of nanotechnology.”
The AFMs are employed in the semiconductor industry, the materials
science field, and the biotechnology industry. AFM life science applications include the imaging of live cells, proteins, and DNA under physiological conditions; single molecule recognition; and the detection of
single biomolecular binding interactions.
The AFM has several advantages over other technologies, which
makes it a favorite with researchers. The chief difference between AFM
and other microscopy techniques is the measure of resolution. While
electron and optical microscopes provide a standard two-dimensional
horizontal view of a sample’s surface, AFM also provides a vertical
view. The resulting images show the topography of a sample’s surface.
While electron microscopes work in a vacuum, most AFM modes work
in ambient or liquid environments. AFM does not require any special sample preparation that could damage the sample or prevent its
reuse.
The number of applications for AFM has increased since the technology of this kind of microscope was invented in the 1980s and
now spans many areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. AFM provides the ability to view and understand events as they occur at the
molecular level. This will increase knowledge of how systems work and
lead to advancements in such areas as drug discovery, life science,

A team of educators and scientists at SRI International in Menlo Park,
California, have designed and implemented a project called NanoSense.
NanoSense introduces high school students and teachers to nanoscale
science concepts and skills. The instructional materials in the program
include hands-on activities, student worksheets, lesson plans, visualizations, and student readings. Hundreds of high school students have used
NanoSense materials.

I invited the team at SRI International to reply to questions about
nanoscience and nanotechnology asked by the high school students
who participated in the NanoSense program. The following are a few of
these questions.

Nanotechnology 101

Where does most nanoscience research take place?
Nanotechnology is a big business. More than $8.6 billion was invested by
governments, companies and venture capitalists worldwide in 2004 and
$60 billion to $70 billion worth of products that incorporate nanotechnology are sold annually in the United States. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) estimates that more than two million people will
be working in nanotechnology within the next 10 years.
The United States is the leader in nanotechnology research, but not
by much. Nanotechnology is the largest federally funded science initiative in the country, receiving over $1 billion in federal funds annually,
and private companies invest at least another $1 billion. Initially, governments made the largest investments in nanotechnology, but this has
changed in recent years, with industry contributing larger and larger
amounts.
Japan has been involved in nanotechnology since the very early stages
and is very close to the United States in its level of development; the
Japanese government invested around $750 million in nanotechnology
in 2004. The Europeans have recently recognized the importance of
nanotechnology and are starting to put a lot of money into nanotechnology projects as well. Finally, countries that are beginning to get into
nanotechnology include India, China, South Africa, and Brazil.
How are nanosized particles made?
Typically we start from the bottom and build up the particles. You begin
by reacting the molecules to form a mixture in which solid particles are
suspended in a liquid. Then you pour this mixture into a mold, where
it becomes a soft, jelly-like material. Finally, you carefully apply heat
and drying treatments to produce the nanoparticles. This technique
is great because it produces a very even distribution of nanoparticle
sizes.
It’s very difficult to take bulk materials and just grind them up to
make nanoparticles; this method usually creates a broad particle size
distribution of both nanoparticles and larger particles. One can isolate
the nanosized particles by setting up a fluid flow in which the small
particles get carried along and the larger ones fall out due to gravity, but
it’s a very tedious and slow process.
Why are gold nanoparticles used in so many medical applications?
Gold nanoparticles are used for three main reasons: first, it’s very easy
to make small, stable nanoparticles of gold; second, nanogold has been
around for hundreds of years and has been used in medicine since the

1800s, so we have a lot of experience working with it; and third, gold is
generally inert, which means that instead of reacting with it or dissolving
it, the body will leave it alone to do what we want it to do.
How close are scientists to making nanorobots that go inside the body?
It depends on what you think of as nanorobots. There is a lot of hype
about miniature versions of metal robots running around in the body or
wreaking havoc on the world, but this is not the reality. But if you think
of a “robot” as a functionalized nanoparticle that goes to a specific place
in the body to do a specific thing, then nanorobots already exist; one
example is drugs that are inserted into nanoparticles of clay because
clay seems to go straight into the cells where the drug by itself wouldn’t.
Could we feel nanorobots inside of us?
No, the particles don’t have enough mass for us to feel them. Just as
they are too small to see, they are too small to feel. In terms of what we
would feel, they are not different from the other chemical substances
we currently put into our bodies.
Are there any possible problems with using nanoparticles
in sunscreens?
Although no adverse effects of nanoparticle sunscreens on humans have
yet been found, there is concern that there may be undiscovered health
issues for nanosized particles. The chemical industries have assumed
that if large particles of a substance are safe, nanosized ones will be
too, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (which must approve
all active ingredients used in sunscreens sold the United States) bases
its approval process on the identity and concentration of a chemical
substance, not the size of the particle.
A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that the safety of
nanoparticles can’t be taken for granted just because larger particles
of the same substance have been proven to be safe. Nanoparticles are
useful precisely because they don’t always act in the same ways as their
larger counterparts. With sunscreens, the concern is that the nanoparticles could penetrate the protective layers of the skin and cause reactions
with ultraviolet light that cause damage to DNA in cells. In 2003 the
European Scientific Committee on Cosmetic and Non-Food Products
(SCCNFP) concluded that titanium dioxide nanoparticles are safe for
cosmetic use, but suggested the need for more tests on the safety of zinc
oxide nanoparticles.
In response to this issue, many researchers are calling for full examination and safety testing of nanoparticles as if they were completely new

NANO ACTIVITY: SUNSCREENS AND SUNLIGHT ANIMATIONS,
ADAPTED FROM SRI INTERNATIONAL’S NANOSENSE UNIT

Student Instructions & Worksheet
This animation worksheet is best used as an in-class activity with
small groups so that students can discuss the different things they
notice in the animations.
Important: These models are meant to provoke questions and stimulate a discussion about how the scattering mechanism works and how
a real-world phenomenon can be represented with a model. As with
all models, they are imperfect representations and are not meant to
be shown to students simply as an example of “what happens.”
Introduction
There are many factors that people take into account when choosing which sunscreen to use. Two of the most important factors that
people consider are the ability to block UV light and how the sunscreen appears on the skin (due to the interaction with visible light).
You are about to see three animations that are models of what happens when sunlight (UV and visible rays) shines on:
r Skin without any sunscreen
r Skin protected by 200 nm ZnO particle sunscreen
r Skin protected by 30 nm ZnO particle sunscreen

Questions
1. Select the UVA and UVB wavelengths of light with no sunscreen and
click the play button.
a. What happens to the skin when the UV light reaches it?
The skin is damaged.

b. How is the damage caused by the UVA rays different from the damage caused by the UVB rays? (You may want to play the animation
with just UVA or UVB selected to answer this question.)
In the animation, UVB light causes a burn on the skin’s surface and
UVA light causes the breakdown in skin fibers deeper in the skin that
leads to premature aging.

c. Based on what you know about the different energies of UVA and
UVB light, why do you think this might happen?
The UVB light causes more immediate damage to the first cells it encounters because it is high energy. The UVA light is lower in energy
and can penetrate deeper into the skin before it does damage. Both
UVB and UVA light also can lead to DNA mutations that cause cancer,
which is not shown in the animation.

2. Now leave UVA and UVB light selected and try playing the animation
first with the 30 nm ZnO sunscreen and then with the 200 nm ZnO
sunscreen.
a. What kind of sunscreen ingredient is shown in each animation?
The 30 nm ZnO is a nanosized inorganic ingredient.
The 200 nm ZnO sunscreen is a traditional inorganic ingredient.

b. What happens to the UV light in the animation of 30 nm ZnO
particle sunscreen?
The UV light is completely blocked via absorption.

c. What happens to the UV light in the animation of 200 nm ZnO
particle sunscreen?
The UV light is completely blocked via absorption.

d. Is there any difference in how the UV light interacts with the 30
nm ZnO particles versus the 200 nm ZnO particles? Explain why

this is so, based on your understanding of how the sunscreens work
to block UV light.
There is no difference in how the 30 nm and 200 nm ZnO particles
interact with the UV light. This is because absorption depends on the
energy levels in the substance, which are primarily determined by the
substance’s chemical identity, not the size of the particle.

e. Is there any difference in how the two kinds of UV light interact with
the sunscreens? Explain why this is so, based on your understanding
of how the sunscreens work to block UV light.
Both UVA and UVB light are fully absorbed because ZnO absorbs
strongly for all wavelengths less than ∼380 nm.
Students may point out that wavelengths of 380–400 nm are UVA light
that might not be absorbed. This is true and can be discussed with the
final question, which addresses the limitations of using models.

3. Select the visible light option and play the animation for each of
the sunscreen conditions. What happens to the visible light in each
animation, and what does the observer see?
a. Skin without any sunscreen
The photons of light pass through the air to the skin. At the skin’s
surface, most of the blue-green (∼400–550 nm) wavelengths of light are
absorbed by pigments in the skin, while the red-orange-yellow (∼550–
700 nm) wavelengths of light are reflected and reach the observer’s
eye. The observer sees the surface of the skin. (Different skin colors are
caused by different amounts and types of the skin pigment melanin).

b. Skin with 200 nm ZnO particles sunscreen
The photons of light pass through the air and are refracted (bent) as
they enter the sunscreen. They are then scattered by the ZnO particles
multiple times until they emerge from the sunscreen and are again
refracted (bent). Since large particles of ZnO scatter all wavelengths
of light equally, all of the different photon wavelengths reach the observer, who sees an opaque white surface. (Note that even though the
animation shows the different colored photons reaching the observer at
different times, in reality there are many photons of each color reaching
the observer at the same time.)

c. Skin with 30 nm ZnO particle sunscreen
The photons of light pass through the air and are refracted (bent)
as they enter the sunscreen. They pass through ZnO particles without being scattered, and at the skin’s surface, most of the blue-green
(∼400–550 nm) wavelengths of light are absorbed by pigments in the
skin, while the red-orange-yellow (∼550–700 nm) wavelengths of light
are reflected. They then pass through the sunscreen again, and are
refracted (bent) when they pass to the air, before they reach the

observer’s eye. The observer sees the surface of the skin and we say
that the sunscreen is “clear.”

4. When we make a model (such as one of these animations), we make
tradeoffs between depicting the phenomenon as accurately as possible
and simplifying it to show the key principles involved. What are some
other ways these animations have simplified the model of the realworld situation they describe?
Example Simplifications:
r The UVA and UVB light are each shown as two identical photons when in

reality there are many more photons involved.
r The wavelengths of the two photons used to represent UVA and UVB light

are shown to be the same when in reality each consists of a range of wavelengths.
r The ZnO particles are shown as “solid” balls when in reality they are clusters

of ions.
r All of the ZnO particles are shown to be the same size, but in reality, there

is a distribution of particle sizes.
r The damage of the UV rays to the skin doesn’t show the DNA mutations

that lead to cancer because of the size and timescale involved.
r The sunscreen solvent is a pale yellow, but it should be clear since it does not

scatter (or absorb) light. How else could this be shown in the animations?

The USDA investment in nanotechnology research has the potential
to have a major impact on agriculture and food processing. One of their
goals is to develop “smart” food packaging with built-in nanosensors to
detect pathogens or contaminants in the product.
FOOD PACKAGING: A MAJOR GOAL USING
NANOTECHNOLOGY METHODS

Today, food packaging and safety are the major goals of food-related
nanotech research and development or R&D. Food companies are working on developing packaging that incorporates lighter and stronger
packages with embedded sensors that can alert a consumer to contamination and or presence of pathogens.
According to industry analysts, the current U.S. market for the nanotechnology of packaging of foods and beverages is an estimated $38
billion, and will grow to $54 billion before 2010. The following includes
a few examples that show nanoscale applications for food and beverage
packaging.
Nano Plastic Packaging

Several chemical companies are producing a nanotechnology transparent plastic film for packaging containing nanoparticles of clay. The
nanoparticles are integrated throughout the plastic and are able to
block oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture from reaching fresh meats
or other foods. The nanoclay particles also make the plastic lighter,
stronger, and more heat-resistant.

antimicrobial packaging for food products. The company is also

to eat.
Another manufacturer of plastics has developed a nano-composite
plastic barrier for food that prevents the flow of oxygen and carbon
dioxide from entering a package. The nanoplastic package keeps all
kinds of products fresher longer. The plastics also block out smells. The
plastic barrier is so strong that it can be useful in making boil-bag food
products and microwavable packaging.

New Kinds of Bottles

Packaging companies are also interested in developing bottles that
are as hard as glass but will not shatter if mishandled. The plastic bottles
contain clay nanoparticles that are as hard as glass but far stronger,
so the bottles are less likely to shatter. The layout of the nanoparticles
is keeping the liquid from spoilage and flavor problems and giving
it up to a six-month shelf life. By embedding nanocrystals in plastic,
researchers have created a molecular barrier that helps prevent the
escape of oxygen. Nanocor and Southern Clay Products are now working
on plastic beverage bottles that may increase shelf life to 18 months.
Foodborne Diseases

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 76
million people suffer from foodborne illnesses each year in the United
States, accounting for 325,000 hospitalizations and more than 5,000
deaths. Foodborne disease is extremely costly. Health experts estimate
that the yearly cost of all foodborne diseases in this country is 5 to 6
billion dollars in medical expenses and lost productivity.
There are more than 250 known foodborne diseases. They can be
caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Some of the foodborne diseases
include botulism, E. coli, salmonellosis, and listeria monocytogenes.
Listeria Monocytogenes in Food

Listeria monocytogenes has recently been recognized as an important public health problem in the United States. Listeriosis is a serious
infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium.
Listeria monocytogenes is found in soil and water. Vegetables can

annually. Salmonella bacteria are often present in polluted water, on
kitchen surfaces, in soil, within the bodies of insects or other animals,
and on factory surfaces. Some of the most common vectors of Salmonella
food poisoning are raw or undercooked meats, raw or undercooked
poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products, fish, shrimp, yeast, coconut, and
egg- or dairy-based sauces and salad dressings.
Infection with Salmonella bacteria is called salmonellosis. It is estimated that from 2 to 4 million cases of salmonellosis infection occur
in the United States annually. This has resulted in more than 16,000
hospitalizations and nearly 600 deaths. The incidence of salmonellosis
appears to be rising both in the United States and in other developed
nations. Billions of dollars are lost in job productivity due to this disease.

NANOSENSORS FOR FOODBORNE CONTAMINATION

Nanotechnology will provide safer and better quality foods for consumers by rapid detecting of pathogens in foods by using systems that
use biosensors. By using biosensors, researchers and food processors can
identify even tiny amounts of pathogens in food before products leave
the food processing plants.
Professor Mohamed Ahmedna is a food scientist at North Carolina
A&T State University. He and his research team are working on ways to
detect contamination, such

the biosensor as, basically, a
device that detects biological organisms such as salmonella or any other bacteria. The biosensors
have the speed that you do not have with traditional methods. Speed is
an issue as also are portability and cost.

This instrumentation may look simple, but tests to date have shown
that it can rapidly detect salmonella. Currently, industry methods for
food-borne bacteria detection can take several days. This biosensor unit,
once refined, may deliver results in just a few hours.
USING FOOD PACKAGING SENSORS IN DEFENSE AND SECURITY
APPLICATIONS



In the view of the U.S. military, it is a national security priority to
detect foodborne pathogens. With the present technologies, testing for
microbial food contamination takes 2 to 7 days for the results. The
sensors that have been developed to date are too big to be transported
easily. In the immediate future, small, portable sensors that can detect
and measure pathogens in food products are needed.
Several groups of researchers in the United States are developing
biosensors that can detect pathogens quickly and easily. These sensors
can play a critical role in the

funding, researchers at Purdue University are developing a handheld sensor capable of detecting a
specific bacteria instantaneously from any sample.
OTHER KINDS OF SENSORS: THE ELECTRONIC NOSE AND THE
ELECTRONIC TONGUE

Two sensors, called the electronic nose and the electronic tongue,
can detect food pathogens. Both these sensors have been used in laboratories, including NASA, to detect trace chemicals. Now, the electronic
nose and the electronic tongue will be applied to the food industry,
since both sensors are especially effective in recognizing contaminants
and analyzing the overall quality of foods.
The Electronic Nose (e-nose) Technology

An electronic nose (e-nose) is a device that identifies the specific
components of an odor and analyzes its chemical makeup to identify it.
In a sense it mimics the human nose, but it has far greater sensitivity to
smell and can trace scents at the nanoparticle level.
Electronic noses are not new. They have been around for several years.
Electronic noses were originally used for quality control applications in

the food, beverage, and cosmetics industries. However, the e-nose is
large and expensive to manufacture.
Current research is focused on making the e-nose smaller, less expensive, and more sensitive. The new and improved e-nose could be used
to detect odors specific to diseases for medical diagnosis, the detection
of pollutants, and gas leaks for environmental protection.
The Electronic Tongue Technology

Similar to the e-nose technology, the electronic tongue, or e-tongue,
mimics the human tongue, but it is more sensitive to flavors in foods.
The e-tongue sensors can detect substances in parts per trillion and
could be used in packaging to trigger a color change that would alert
the consumer if a food had become contaminated or if it had begun to
spoil.
Food researchers believe the electronic tongue is going to be vital to
food studies. As an example, a meat package with a built-in tongue can
taste the first signs of spoilage and activate a color change as a warning
to the consumer.
The electronic tongue is made from a silicon chip that has microbeads
arrayed on it. Each of the beads responds to different analytes. The
different analytes of the e-tongue are similar to the taste buds on the
human tongue. The e-tongue responds to sweet, sour, salty, and bitter
tastes in a similar fashion as the taste buds on your tongue do.
The food and beverage industries may see the potential to use the
e-tongue to develop a digital library of tastes. The collected data would
include tastes that have been proven to be popular with consumers. The
e-tongue could also monitor the flavors of existing products. Probably
more importantly, the e-tongue could be used for brand security and
tracking the supply chain of foods that normally cannot be tagged with
traditional bar codes.
NANO BAR CODES DETECT FOODBORNE DISEASES

Another kind of sensor technology is the nano bar code. Nano bar
codes are similar to the traditional bar codes that are found on many
packaged food products today. However, the nano bar codes, containing
metal nanoparticles, could be used to detect pathogens. The nanoparticles have specific, recognizable chemical fingerprints that can be read
by a machine, an ultraviolet lamp, or an optical microscope. Using
these kinds of bar codes, a supermarket checkout computer can identify thousands of different items by scanning the tiny bar code printed

on the package. The scanning of the barcode could reveal spoilage or
pathogens within the food package.
A research group headed by Dan Luo, Cornell assistant professor of
biological engineering, has created “nanobarcodes.” The nanobarcodes
fluoresce under ultraviolet light in a combination of colors that can
be read by a computer scanner or observed with a fluorescent light
microscope.
Summarizing, nanosensors such as electronic tongues and electronic
noses plus the use of nanobarcodes have the potential to provide safe
food products and packaging. The embedded sensors in food packaging
will respond to the release of particular chemicals when a certain food
begins to spoil. So, as soon as the food starts to go bad, the packaging
will change color to warn the shopper. This system could also provide a
more accurate and safer method than the present “sell by dates” marked
on food products.
AGRICULTURE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY

The application of pesticides has become a controversial topic due to
claims that some products can damage the environment and even get
into the food chain. As an example, it has been estimated that about
2.5 million tons of pesticides are used on crops each year. The worldwide
damage caused by pesticides reaches $100 billion annually. One of the
reasons for the damage is the high toxicity and nonbiodegradability of
pesticides. Pesticides that are applied directly to the soil may be washed
off the land into nearby bodies of surface water or may percolate through
the soil to lower soil layers and groundwater. When this happens, the
pesticide becomes a pollution hazard and is highly toxic to humans and
other organisms.
BIOSENSOR DETECTS HERBICIDES ON THE FARM

Researchers are hoping a new biosensor may help farmers and regulatory officials detect herbicides in soil and water samples. Herbicides are
used to control unwanted plants such as weeds. However, heavy applications of herbicides can leave environmentally unsafe residues in soil
and water.
The new biosensor is made of a chlorophyll-like chemical that can
measure oxygen levels. This chemical produces oxygen in the presence
of certain chemicals and light.
In testing for a herbicide, a liquid sample is passed through the biosensor. If the sample contains a herbicide, it will react with the biosensor’s

detects oxygen levels and sends the information to a computer that displays the data in graph form. Reading the oxygen levels from the data a
scientist can determine if too much or too little of herbicides has been
applied to the soil. The biosensor can also identify traces of chemical
residues in a matter of minutes.
Nanoscale Herbicides

Other researchers are focusing on ways to reduce the use of herbicides
all together. Their research includes using nanoparticles to attack the
seed coating of weeds, which will prevent them from germinating.
The researchers report that this approach will destroy the weed even
when it is buried in soil, and will prevent them from growing even

high-maintenance methods. Using small proportions of nanoscale herbicides, the nanoparticles can easily blend with soil and attack weeds
that are buried below the reach of tillers and conventional herbicides.
More research has to be conducted to make sure the nanoparticles can
be used safely in the soil.
A FOOD SAFETY ISSUE

The issue of food safety has also been heightened by the possibilities of bioterrorism. Global businesses, government agencies, and other

organizations are now looking at a variety of technologies, as well as
nanotechnologies that can trace food distribution from the farms, the
food-processing companies, to the stores and supermarkets.
ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY AND FOOD RESEARCH

An estimated 25–81 million cases of foodborne illness and an estimated 9,000 deaths are associated with consumption of contaminated
foods each year. Therefore, the presence of microbial and chemical
pathogens at any stage of food production, processing, and distribution
must be quickly determined in order to allow proper treatments before
food consumption by the general public. To help achieve these goals,
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other agencies use the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The AFM is implemented
in food science research to observe the nanoscale structure of foods and
other biomaterials and for investigating diseases, such as E. coli cells
and salmonella.
SUSTAINABLE WATERING OF CROPS

Agricultural scientists are exploring different ways to use water in a
more sustainable way for irrigation. Presently, the main disadvantage of
using irrigation is that it requires a lot of water, much of which is lost
to evaporation. In some farm areas, more than 50 percent of water may
be lost to evaporation. The high evaporation rate may also decrease soil
fertility through salinization.
Nanotechnology researchers would like to come up with a way to apply
water slowly into the ground with a minimum of runoff and evaporation.
One idea is to use the mineral zeolites to do the job.
Zeolites are microporous crystalline minerals that contain silicon,
aluminium, and oxygen. Zeolites are used in petroleum refineries and
for water softening and purification products.
The researchers are interested in using zeolites in water irrigation
systems because the mineral can absorb about half its own volume of
water. The zeolites would

whereby they will absorb up

to plants.
Using zeolites in a water irrigation system has several advantages over
other conventional irrigation methods. First, the zeolites could reduce
the total amount of water needed to irrigate crops, making this kind of

irrigation method useful in regions with limited water supplies. Second,
little water is lost to the air through evaporation or to the soil via percolation because water is released slowly and over a small area. At the
same time, fewer salts are deposited in the soil, helping to preserve soil
quality.
LIVESTOCK DISEASES

The worldwide livestock industry is interested in measures that would
guarantee the safety of the food supply provided by livestock. Outbreaks
of livestock disease have resulted in export bans and collapsed markets.
As one example, in the United Kingdom, the Mad Cow Disease crisis in
the late 1990s led to a 40 per cent domestic decline in beef sales and the
complete loss of many export markets.
Mad cow disease is the commonly used name for Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE). The disease is a slowly progressive, degenerative,
fatal disease affecting the central nervous system of adult cattle. The
exact cause of BSE is not known.
Scientists are now exploring nanotechnology applications such as the
use of small drug delivery devices. The devices could be implanted into
cattle to avoid diseases such as BSE from entering the animals’ central
nervous system.
BIOCHIPS FOR DISEASE DETECTION IN LIVESTOCK

Scientists at the Kopelman Laboratory at the University of Michigan
are developing noninvasive nanosensors to test livestock diseases. One
of these nanosensors could perhaps be placed in, say, a cow’s saliva gland
in order to detect single virus particles long before the virus has had a
chance to multiply and long before disease symptoms are evident.
Researchers at the University of Pretoria, for example, are developing
biochips that will detect common diseases borne by ticks. A biochip (or
microarray) is a device typically made of hundreds or

fect only birds and, less commonly, pigs.
Chips can be used for early
disease detection in animals.
Biochips can also be used to trace the source of food and feeds. For
example, a biochip tests livestock feed to detect the presence of animal
products from forty different species as a means to locate the source of

pathogens—a response to public health threats such as avian flu and
mad cow disease.
Biochips for Animal Breeding

One goal is to functionalize biochips for breeding purposes. With
the mapping of the human genome behind them, geneticists are now
rapidly sequencing the genomes of cattle, sheep, poultry, pig, and other
livestock hoping to identify gene sequences that relate to commercially
valuable traits, such as disease resistance, and leanness of meat. By including probes for these traits on biochips, breeders will be able to
identify champion breeders and screen out genetic diseases.
NANOSENSORS TO TRACK LIVESTOCK

Livestock tracking has been a problem for farmers. The USDA envisions the rise of “smartherds”—cows, sheep, and pigs fitted with sensors
and locators relaying data about their health and geographical location
to a central computer.
Implanting tracking devices in animals has been initiated for pets,
valuable farm animals, or for animal wildlife conservation. Injectable
microchips are already used in a variety of ways with the aim of improving
animal welfare and safety to
r study animal behavior in the wild,
r track meat products back to their source, and
r reunite strays with their human owners.

NANOTECHNOLOGY IN AQUACULTURE AND FISH FARMING

Aquaculture is the cultivation of fish, shellfish, or aquatic plants in natural or controlled marine or freshwater environments. Estimates report
that about 20 percent of all commercial fish are raised in an aquaculture environment, and that this industry will continue to grow in the
21st century.
Today, aquaculture is a multimillion dollar business. Much of the
trout, catfish, and shellfish consumed in the United States are products of aquaculture. Global demand for seafood is projected to increase by 70 percent in the next 30 years. In fact, the world’s fastest
growing area of animal production is the farming of fish, crustaceans,
and mollusks, particularly in Asia. A consensus is growing that a dramatic increase in aquaculture is needed to supply future aquatic food
needs.

Environmental Concern of Aquaculture

However, there are problems with some of the fish farms, particularly shrimp-raising farms. Disease outbreaks, chemical pollution, and
the environmental destruction of marshes and mangroves have been
linked with fish farm activities. Environmentalists believe more sustainable practices are needed to control the potential for pollution and the
damage of natural resources. There is also concern about the accidental
releasing of cultivated fish into natural populations and what effects that
might have.
Cleaning Fish Ponds with Nanotechnology Devices

Researchers believe that nanotechnology may have the potential to
provide fishponds that are safe from disease and pollution. One company, Altair Nanotechnologies, makes a water-cleaning product for fishponds called NanoCheck. It uses 40-nanometer particles of a lanthanumbased compound that absorbs phosphates from the water and prevents
algae growth.
Altair sees a potentially large demand for NanoCheck for use in thousands of commercial fish farms worldwide where algae removal and
prevention is costly at present. According to Altair, the company plans
to expand its tests to confirm that its nanoparticles will not harm fish.
DNA Nanovaccines Using Nanocapsules and Ultrasound Methods

The USDA is completing trials on a system for mass vaccination of fish
in fishponds using ultrasound. Nanocapsules containing short strands
of DNA are added to a fishpond where they are absorbed into the cells of
the fish. Ultrasound is then used to rupture the capsules, releasing the
DNA and eliciting an immune response from the fish. This technology
has so far been tested on rainbow trout by Clear Springs Foods (Idaho,
US)—a major aquaculture company that produces about one-third of
all U.S. farmed trout.
FOREST PRODUCT INDUSTRY AND NANOTECHNOLOGY

According to recent research, the future of the U.S. forest products
industries, which employ some 1.1 million Americans and contribute
more than $240 billion annually to the nation’s economy, could depend on how well those industries embrace the emerging science of
nanotechnology.

The hundred-page report, titled “Nanotechnology for the Forest
Products Industry—Vision and Technology Roadmap,” is based on presentations and discussion by some 110 researchers from North America
and Europe, with an interest in wood, paper, or other forest products,
to explore the possible role of nanotechnology in the forest products
industries.
The “Roadmap,” so called because it is intended to show where the
forest products industry needs to go and how to get there, describes the
U.S. forest products industry as a mature, somewhat stagnant energyintensive industry that is facing new global competition. The report,
which is the first comprehensive look at nanotechnology for the U.S.
forest products industry, suggests that the infusion of nanotechnology
could lead to new and improved products. It also could lead to improved
and more efficient manufacturing processes.
“Nanotechnology represents a major opportunity to generate new
products and industries in the coming decades,” the Roadmap says.
Potential uses of nanotechnology in forest products, as identified
in the Roadmap, include development of intelligent wood- and paperbased products that could incorporate built-in nanosensors to measure
forces, loads, moisture levels, temperatures, or pressures, or detect the
presence of wood-decay fungi or termites. According to the Roadmap,
nanotechnology can have an even greater impact by providing benefits
that extend well beyond food products but into the areas of sustainable
energy production, storage, and utilization.

in developing a biosensor that detects glucose levels in patients with
diabetes.
Dr. Paranjape is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics
at Georgetown University (Washington, DC), where he joined the faculty in 1998. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the
University of Alberta (Edmonton) in 1993, and held postdoctoral researcher positions at Concordia University (Montreal), Simon Fraser
University (Vancouver), and the University of California (Berkeley). In
1995, through a collaborative project with U.C. Berkeley, Dr. Paranjape
joined the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (IRST) in
Trento, Italy, as a research consultant.
Dr. Paranjape and a team at Georgetown University and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) have developed a biosensor
micro-device that has the potential to be used by people who have diabetes. The biosensor is in the form of a small adhesive patch to be worn

on the skin and is very convenient to use and makes measuring glucose
levels completely pain-free and in a minimally invasive manner. The multidisciplinary project was funded for over 3 years with technical expertise
coming from several scientific backgrounds: one other physics professor, one professor in pharmacology, two senior researchers from SAIC
(biochemistry and engineering), six postdoctoral researchers (chemistry, materials engineering, biochemistry, microfabrication specialists,
and two electrical engineers), and several undergraduate and graduate
students in the physics program.
Where did you grow up and what were some of your favorite activities
and subjects as a teenager?
I was born in England but I grew up in Canada and lived as a teenager in
a small town called Thunder Bay, which is right on Lake Superior, almost
30 miles from the United States border north of Minnesota. I enjoyed
racquet sports, skiing, and playing hockey—my favorite position was
playing goal.
What colleges did you attend and what was your major?
I completed my undergraduate and graduate degrees, including my
Ph.D., all in electrical engineering, at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. It was during this time when Wayne Gretzky, one of my
hockey idols, was playing for the Edmonton Oilers, a National Hockey
League team that won several back-to-back Stanley Cups while I was in
school.
Presently, what subjects do you teach at Georgetown University?
I have an electrical engineering degree, so I teach related subjects such
as electricity and magnetism, and electronics to both physics undergraduates and graduate students.
What interested you to become a physics professor, and how did you
cross over and get interested in the field of diabetes and in being on a
team that developed a new biosensor device for glucose monitoring?
My early interests were to follow in my dad’s footsteps. He is a physicist
by training. I also thought about medicine, as well. I liked math a lot and
enjoyed hands-on work, but my high school biology skills were not that
great. So I wanted to go into physics, but my dad said there are not that
many jobs (or money) in this field. He thought that since I was mathoriented and a hands-on type person, I should consider engineering. So
that is how I ended up in electrical engineering.

How did you get involved in biosensors?
The last time I took a biology course was in the 12th grade and I have
not taken any biology courses since then.
After I finished my Ph. D., I started to dabble in biology and biosensors during a time when I was employed as a postdoctoral researcher
at Simon Fraser University. During this time, while I was involved in a
project to accurately measure the mass of individual cells, such as baby
hamster kidney cells, using a relatively new emerging technology called
biological microelectromechanical systems (or bio-MEMS), I became
very interested in fabricating devices using microtechnologies, whether
they are sensors or “machines” that could interact with biological cells.
This work was very intriguing to me. Anyway, this is how I got into biosensors. I got involved with the glucose-monitoring project soon after arriving at Georgetown University in 1998. Our research team was already
involved in fabricating noninvasive microdevices for health applications,
and after winning a U.S. Defense Department contract for monitoring
glucose and lactate in a soldier, the minimally-invasive glucose patch was
developed.
What is the conventional way a person living with diabetes uses to
measure and monitor his or her glucose level? Approximately, how
many times a day does a person have to do this routine?
Typically a person with diabetes, and depending on the severity of the
disease, should sample his or her glucose level at least twice a day. And
that is the minimum. Typically it is done 3 to 5 times a day—once
when you get up, once after breakfast, once after lunch, and once after
dinner, and finally once before bedtime. The more often you monitor
your readings, the better control you have on the disease. However, the
more you monitor, the more painful the process can be for many people
with diabetes. Remember you are sticking a needle in your finger to draw
blood and there is always going to be pain associated with this approach.
And one of the big issues related to diabetes control is that many people,
because of the pain, will not sample themselves the number of times they
should in order to control their diabetes. Then after getting a blood
sample, and depending on the glucose reading, a person would inject
insulin, if needed. And this can occur after each glucose reading.
How does the new biosensor device work without puncturing the skin
and what are the benefits of the device for patients?
For the past few years, the team has been developing and testing a new
biosensor device for glucose monitoring. The size of a small band-aid,
it is designed to be worn anywhere on the body, where the biosensor

samples tiny amounts of fluids that lie just beneath the top layer of
skin.
The device is small and convenient, and makes measuring glucose
levels pain-free and minimally invasive.
The biosensor device works to painlessly remove the outer dermis,
or dead-skin layer, by using a “micro-hotplate.” The hotplate temperature is carefully controlled to apply a small amount of power. The
“hotplate” is turned on to a temperature of 130o C. This sounds hot,
but in such a small spot the size of a hair follicle, and for such a
short time, a person cannot even detect the heat, or feel any pain,
as it is applied to the very outer layers of skin. The biosensor then
determines the glucose levels from the sample of fluid, which rises to
the skin surface through the micro-pores created by the hotplate, using tiny micro-electrodes that have been coated with a substance that
reacts specifically to the glucose. The fluid being sampled is interstitial fluid and not blood, which is commonly used to monitor glucose
levels.
Can young people who are 12 years old or younger use the biosensor
device? Are there any age limits?
Any age group can use the biosensor. The ultimate goal of the device
is not just to monitor the glucose level but eventually, to take steps
to actually inject insulin. The biosensor will form a complete closed
loop system so the device will effectively monitor glucose levels and
deliver any insulin if needed. In a sense the envisioned device would
perform as both biosensor and drug delivery system for the person with
diabetes.
How long does the present biosensor patch last on the body?
The present patch contains several sensing sites and each of these sites
provides a one-time glucose reading. When you are out of sensing sites,
then the patch is removed. And this depends on how many times you
are sensing your glucose level. The patch, when marketed, could last for
about two weeks depending on the person who will test their glucose
levels say 2 to 3 times a day. However, if you were able to add more and
more sensing sites, then a patch could last much longer.
Is the biosensor device still being tested, and if so, when do you think
the device would be available people with diabetes?
Usually there is a long process needed for FDA approval of any new drug
or new medical devices. However, the patch has some advantages in that
it is a minimally invasive patch because you do not need to implant it

and you do not need to have to collect blood. Typically these kinds of
devices are fast-tracked through FDA approval. Once the devices have
been fully tested using animals, and then after performing clinical trials
on human subjects, you can apply for FDA approval. It will take about
2 years more for testing on humans. And then the fast track will take
about 1 to 2 years for FDA approval.
What are some other possible applications for the biosensor device?
Let me start by saying this project was sponsored by the Department of
Defense, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). They
were interested in using a patch technology, similar to our designed
biosensor patch. The patch would be for the war fighter on the battlefield who could succumb to trauma due to huge losses of blood. Blood
lost is critical so you need to minimize the blood lost as quickly as you can
to have a chance of saving the injured trooper. In this application, troops
would be sent onto a battlefield, fitted with a biosensor patch placed on
their arms. The patch would not hinder them from continuing their
duties.
If injured, the patch would record data about the severity of the
trooper’s wounds based on their glucose and lactate levels (and any other
readily available bio-molecule that can be sampled with our patch). The
data would be sent by short-range telemetry to a medic’s palm pilot,
for example. The palm pilot would show the location of the injured
trooper. The severity of the injury would also be ascertained. If the
medic observed dangerous changes in a soldier’s body biochemistry,
that soldier would be assisted first, and then removed from the field
for medical care. So in our continued research, we incorporated the
military application with the civilian application kept in mind—that is,
detecting glucose in people with diabetes.
Do you see other uses of this kind of biosensor?
There is a whole list of applications. One other area of interest is
to detect, in newborns, the potential of jaundice before its onset.
The new mother and baby would leave the hospital and a biosensor
patch would be placed on the child’s arm. If any signs of jaundice
would appear when the child is at home, the patch, which monitors
a biomolecule called bilirubin, would signal an alert. In this way, you
would catch the jaundice earlier and then proceed with medical care.
The patch would perform the sensing without pain, unlike current methods that involve inserting a heel stick to draw blood from the newborn’s
heel.

What advice would you give young people who would like a career in
biomedical research developing biosensors and other microdevices for
diagnostics?
In high school, there is not much overlapping of subjects between the
various science disciplines. However, at the college level, and in the
real world, there is a lot of interaction and collaboration that takes
place between people who have various backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and engineering. You do not need to be
an expert in everything. You can have your own expertise in one subject but always consult others in different fields to see what else can be
done.

Soil Uses
Each state in the United States has selected a state soil, 20 of which have been
legislatively established. Soils, because of their chemical and physical properties
determine land use purposes, such as farming, mining, and ranching and even
housing. For a science report, you may want to research and write about your state’s
soil and how the land is used for agriculture and other uses. You can write about
topics that include soil quality, soil risks and hazards, and soil salinity and plant

Nanotechnology for
a Sustainable
Environment
We have learned from the previous chapters that applications of nanotechnology have the potential to change and improve everything from
medical care and food safety to consumer products and electronics.
In addition to these benefits, nanotechnology may help build a more
sustainable environment by providing clean drinking water, better air
quality, new sources of energies, and a reduction in hazardous and toxic
wastes.

NANOTECHNOLOGY AND SAFER DRINKING WATER

Arsenic contamination, both naturally occurring and resulting from
human activities, in drinking water is a global problem. For one example,
in India, millions of people suffer from arsenic poisoning found in
drinking water.
Cleaning Up Arsenic

Scientists are now developing strategies to clean up the arsenic, a
carcinogen, in the water. Scientists at Rice University’s Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) have developed
a low-cost technology for cleaning arsenic from drinking water. The
technology holds promise for millions of people not only in India
but also in Bangladesh and in other developing countries where thousands of cases of arsenic poisoning are linked to poisoned wells each
year.
The scientists discovered that nanoparticles of iron oxide (rust) could
be used to remove arsenic in water by using a magnetic field. Arsenic

by using a low-powered magnet that attracts the particles. Once the particles are extracted, the water
becomes safe to drink.
The Element Arsenic

The element arsenic is a steel grey metal-like material. Arsenic is
a natural part of our environment and widely distributed in Earth’s
crust. So living organisms are often exposed to some amount of it.
Very low levels of it are always present in soil, water, food, and air.
Most arsenic compounds have no smell or special taste, even when
present in drinking water. Arsenic has been used in pesticides, poisons, chicken-feed supplements, and wood preservatives. However, the
naturally occurring arsenic in the soil can make the water toxic to
humans.

Nanotechnology and Water Filters

Several companies are developing nanotechnology-based filters that
will clean polluted water. The filters in the treatment system can sift out
bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and organic material.

One filter product consists of spiral-wound layers of fiberglass sheets.
The sheets create a permeable surface of nano-sized pores—a bit-like a
nanoscale strainer. When pressure is exerted, the water pushes through
the pores keeping out viruses and bacteria that are too large to go
through the pores.
In Australia, one company has patented a water treatment technology
that uses nanoparticles for water purification. The product called MesoLite has been tested in several countries. The treatment can be used to
remove ammonia from contaminated wastewaters. Once the ammonia
has been extracted in the treatment stage, the leftover ammonia can be
recycled and used as a commercial fertilizer. The MesoLite process can
also be used as a backup system to support large wastewater treatment
plants.
DRINKING WATER FROM THE OCEAN

The need for a sustainable, affordable supply of clean water is a key
priority for the United States’ future and especially for states that have
few freshwater sources and a fast-growing population. One source of
providing more fresh water to ocean-side states is to transform unusable
water from the ocean into valuable freshwater. Desalination is the process that is used for removing dissolved salts from seawater and brackish
water.
Reverse Osmosis

In a water desalination treatment system, reverse osmosis is a separation process that uses pressure to force a solvent, such as water, through
a membrane that retains the solute, such as salt ions, on one side and
allows pure water to pass to the other side. However, reverse osmosis
treatment units use a lot of water and energy and therefore can be
costly to operate. As an example, some reverse osmosis treatment plants
recover only 5 to 15 percent of pure water entering the system. The
remainder is discharged as wastewater. One nanotechnology group may
have a way to reduce costs of conventional desalination treatments by
using carbon nanotubes.
A New Kind of Reverse Osmosis

Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are
developing a water desalination system using carbon nanotube-based
membranes. The use of the carbon nanotubes in the membranes could
reduce the cost of desalination by 75 percent, compared to reverse
osmosis methods used today.

Nanotechnology for a Sustainable Environment

The carbon nanotubes used by the researchers are sheets of carbon
atoms rolled so tightly that only seven water molecules can fit across
their diameter. Their small size makes them a good source for separating
molecules. The nanopores also reduce the amount of pressure needed
to force water through the membrane As a result, there are savings
in energy costs when compared to reverse osmosis using conventional
membranes.
Water Pollution: Using the Atomic Force Microscope to
Study Water Pollution

Virginia Tech researchers are using an atomic force microscopy
(AFM) to observe how a bacterium adheres to the silica surfaces of
soil. This sticking efficiency of bacteria has not been previously measured experimentally using the AFM. The researchers believe if they
can learn how bacteria can adhere or stick on to various soil surfaces,
then they can use the information to predict how bacteria in the soil
particles can be removed and transported in the groundwater.
GROUNDWATER POLLUTANTS

In the United States, approximately 50 percent of the people depend
on underground water naturally stored in aquifers. Surface water provides the other source of fresh water. In fact, many of the rural areas of
the United States depend almost entirely on groundwater. But some of
the nation’s groundwater is contaminated, say scientists, and clean up
could cost hundreds of billions of dollars as well as several decades to
complete.
Groundwater occurs beneath Earth’s surface at depths of a few centimeters to more than 300 meters (900 feet). The water that is available
for human use by pumping operations is within the zone of saturation.
The zone of saturation is where the spaces between particles of soil or
spaces within fractures of rock that compose the aquifer are entirely
filled with groundwater. Groundwater concerns include the leaching of
pollutants such as arsenic and MTBE (a gasoline additive, now banned)
into the water making it unfit for human consumption. The leaching
of buried toxic and hazardous wastes can also pollute groundwater resources.
GROUNDWATER CLEANUP

Scientists are developing different technologies for cleaning up pollutants in groundwater.

Iron Nanoparticles May Be Effective in Cleaning Up Waste Sites

Professor Zhang of Lehigh University has been working for several years to develop a remediation method to clean up groundwater contaminants, using nanoscale metallic particles. He has been
field-testing the method at several industrial sites. The industrial sites
are contaminated with such toxicants as polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs), DDT (a potent pesticide), and dioxin. These are all chlorinated hydrocarbons and persistent organic pollutants of types that are
fairly insoluble in water; they are found mostly in soil sediments, and
fatty animal tissue. So far, the results of his research have been very
encouraging.
Professor Zwang’s technology involves pumping nanoparticles (ironbased particles measuring 100 to 200 nm) into the contaminated
groundwater. The nanoparticles are almost all iron with less than 1 percent palladium. Palladium (Pd) is a rare silver-white metal and is used as
a catalyst in catalytic converters on cars. When the iron-based nanoparticles are applied to water or soil contaminated with carcinogenic
chlorinated solvents, the particles remove the chlorine and convert the

solvents into harmless hydrocarbons and chloride, commonly found in
table salt.
Professor Zhang’s nanoremediation offers potential advantages over
existing conventional methods. One of the advantages is that nanoremediation avoids digging up the contaminated soil and treating it—this
is a very costly treatment process.
CLEANING UP ORGANIC POLLUTANTS USING
NANOTECHNOLOGY

Trichloroethene or TCE is one of the most common and poisonous
organic pollutants in U.S. groundwater and one of the nation’s most
pervasive and troublesome groundwater pollutants. TCE is an industrial
solvent used primarily in metal degreasing and cleaning operations.
TCE is found at 60 percent of the contaminated waste sites on the
Superfund National Priorities List, and it is considered one of the most
hazardous chemicals at these sites because of its prevalence and its toxicity. Superfund is the common name for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980.
This is a federal law whose mission is to clean up the worst hazardous and
toxic waste site areas on land and water. These sites constitute threats to
human health and the environment.
TCE, as a volatile organic compound (VOC), has a tendency to
volatilize or escape from groundwater into the air. When this process
of volatilization happens in groundwater beneath a building, the TCE
can enter the building as a vapor, which can produce an air quality or
inhalation hazard to people within the building.
TCE can be absorbed through the lungs, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and the skin. Exposure to TCE happens mostly from
breathing contaminated air and drinking contaminated water. Shortterm exposure to high levels of this chemical can result in toxic effects
on a number of organs and systems, including the liver, kidney, blood,
skin, immune system, reproductive system, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. In humans, acute inhalation exposure to TCE causes
central nervous system symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea,
and unconsciousness. TCE has been linked to liver damage, impaired
pregnancies, and cancer.
TCE Cleanup with Gold Nanoparticles

Cost is the major hurdle to cleaning up TCE-polluted groundwater.
Cleanup costs for TCE nationwide are estimated in the billions of dollars.

Nanotechnology 101

The Department of Defense alone estimates the cost of bringing its
1,400 TCE-contaminated sites into Environmental PA compliance at
more than $5 billion.
Researchers at Rice University and Georgia Institute of Technology
have found that gold nanoparticles coated with palladium are extremely
effective catalysts for breaking down toxic chemicals such as TCE into
less harmful products. Using a treatment of gold nanoparticles, the
researchers hope to drive down the costs of cleanup operations by
eliminating:
r the drilling costs for new wells,
r the construction costs for surface treatment facilities, and
r the energy costs of pumping up water to the surface.

Tests have found that the gold-palladium nanocatalysts break TCE
down about 100 times faster than bulk palladium catalysts. One of the
major advantages of using palladium catalysts to break down TCE is
that palladium converts TCE directly into nontoxic ethene and ethane,
colorless, odorless, and gaseous hydrocarbons.
The researchers have another idea and that is to develop a device
that would include a cylindrical pump containing a catalytic membrane
of the gold-palladium nanoparticles. The device would be placed down
existing wells where it would pump water through continuously breaking
the TCE into nontoxic components.
CLEANING UP NUCLEAR WASTE SITES

Scientists believe that using gold-palladium nanoparticles may have
an impact on other toxic waste sites, such as the Hanford Nuclear Waste
Site located in the southeastern part of Washington State. The site,
near the Columbia River, contains nuclear waste material since the end
of World War II. Many environmental activists are concerned that the
waste will get into the groundwater. So, maybe a new kind of treatment
method using nanoparticles could play a role in preventing the spread
of the nuclear wastes into the groundwater.
AIR POLLUTION

Air pollution is a major health problem in the United States and
throughout the world. An estimated 3 million people die each year
from the effects of air pollutants. Medical researchers have linked high
levels of air pollution to illnesses and diseases. These health problems

include asthma, allergies, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, lung cancer,
and heart attacks. Pollutants in the air cost citizens billions of dollars
every year in health care and lost time at work. In a major health study
conducted by the American Lung Association, about 50 percent of the
United States population is breathing unhealthy amounts of air pollution. Other countries suffer from air pollution too.
Titanium Dioxide and Clean Air

Walking down a street in central London, a person may suddenly feel
that the air quality is quite clean. The sidewalk has been treated with
a nanotechnology product containing catalytic properties that break
down molecules in harmful pollutant emissions in the air. In Milan
(Italy) and Paris (France), there are similar concrete sidewalks that are
treated with titanium dioxide (TiO2 ). According to some experts, the
titanium dioxide concrete slabs have reduced pollutants during rush
hour by 60 to 70 percent in these two cities.
Japan’s Mitsubishi Materials Corporation has developed a paving
stone that uses the catalytic properties of TiO2 to remove nitrogen
oxides (NOx ) from the air. Nitrogen oxides are emitted into the air
primarily from the emissions of automobiles and power plants that burn
petroleum and coal. The paving stone breaks down nitrogen oxides into
more environmental-friendly substances such as nitric acid ions. These
ions can then be washed away by rainfall or neutralized by the alkaline
composition of the concrete.
What Is Titanium Dioxide?

Titanium dioxide is a white powder. It is used as a whitener for paints,
in food products, toothpaste, and many other consumer goods. Titanium dioxide is a strong photocatalyst. A photocatalyst produces surface
oxidation to eliminate bacteria and other materials when it is exposed
to the sun or a fluorescent lamp. Therefore, when a product is made
of TiO2 in the sun, organic compounds such as dirt, mold and mildew,
and bacteria break down, without consuming the TiO2

Another advantage of products made from titanium dioxide is that
it has a self-cleaning surface. When water hits the titanium dioxide, a
smooth sheet forms instead of tiny droplets. The sheet of water gets
under the dirt and lifts it off the surface and washes it away. The combination of these effects makes TiO2 self-cleaning to a large extent, and
it can be applied in microscopically thin coatings to building materials,
glass, or even fabrics.
Scientists in Hong Kong are developing dirt-resistant clothing with
titanium dioxide and a Japanese company has manufactured ceramic
tiles using the chemical.

The Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 and was
established in response to growing public concern about: unhealthy air,
polluted rivers and groundwater, unsafe drinking water, endangered
species, and hazardous waste disposal.
The agency’s mission is to “protect public health and to safeguard
the natural environment—air, water, and land—upon which human
life depends.” Its areas of responsibility include control of air pollution and water pollution, solid waste management, protection of the
drinking water supply, and pesticide regulation. The EPA is aware that

Department of Energy

The Department of Energy’s (DOE) goal is to advance the national,
economic, and energy security of the United States. The department’s
strategic goals to achieve the mission are designed to deliver results
along strategic themes that include:
r Energy Security: Promoting America’s energy security through reliable,
clean, and affordable energy,
r Environmental Responsibility: Protecting the environment by providing
a responsible resolution to the environmental legacy of nuclear weapons
production.
NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY SOURCES

In this century, along with renewal energy sources such as wind energy,
geothermal energy, and nuclear energy, many companies are focusing
on the technology to produce photovoltaic solar cells and hydrogen fuel
cells.
Solar Photovoltaic Cell (PV)

A solar photovoltaic cell (PV) is a device that converts solar energy
into electricity in a manner that does not release any pollutants to the
environment. Today, solar cells are commonly used to power small-sized
items such as calculators and watches. But solar PVs have a great future
in providing all the electricity needs for rural communities, homes, and
businesses. The future for solar cell production and their usage is very
promising as a renewable energy resource. However, the technology still
remains expensive when compared to the costs of fossil fuels to produce
electricity.
Solar cells have two major challenges: they cost too much to make (in
the form of energy), and they are not very efficient. Although efficiencies
of 30 percent have been achieved, the present-day typical efficiencies
for solar cells is from 15 to 20 percent. However, solar nano researchers
believe they can make solar cells more efficient.

Quantum Dots for Solar Cells

Much of the sun’s energy is wasted by today’s photovoltaic cells.
When solar photons strike a solar cell, they release electrons in the
semiconductor to produce an electric
current. However, when an electron is
set free by the photon, it collides often
with a nearby atom making it less likely
to set another electron free. So even
though the sun’s solar photons carry
enough energy to release several electrons, producing more electricity, they
are limited to one electron per solar
photon. As a result, conventional solar
cells operate at 15 to 20 percent efficiency using solar energy.
Scientists have been doing a lot of research and experiments with quantum
dots to make photovoltaic cells more
efficient. Researchers at the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
and the Los Alamos National Laboratory
have been experimenting with quantum
dots as a semiconductor in a solar cell.
They have discovered that the use of the
quantum dots allows solar energy to release multiple electrons, not just one.
This research has the potential to make
major improvements in the manufacturing of photovoltaic cells. The two research teams have calculated that a maxFigure 8.2 Konarka Technologies deR

Hydrogen Fuel Cells

The next technological advance in energy will be the use of fuel
cells. Hydrogen fuel cells are devices that directly convert hydrogen into
electricity. Fuel cells can provide electricity to power motor vehicles and
to heat and light homes, office buildings, and factories.
The hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is also an excellent alternative to fossil fuel vehicles because hydrogen produces no carbon dioxide when
burned, and the fuel cell requires little maintenance because it has few
moving parts.
Fuel Cells and the Automobile Industry

ural gas as the main fuel
for automobiles, buses, and
trucks.
There are many different types of hydrogen fuel cells that use different electrolytes, operate at different temperatures, and are suited to
different uses. Presently, the most popular fuel cell for automobiles is
called the proton exchange membrane (PEM). It is a lightweight fuel
cell that is one of the easiest to build. The outside portion of the fuel
cell, or membrane, is coated with platinum, which acts as a catalyst.
Hydrogen under great pressure and temperature is forced through the
catalyst. At this point, the element is stripped of its electrons, allowing
them to move through a circuit to produce electricity. The hydrogen
protons pass through the membrane and combine with oxygen in the
outside air to form water. There is no polluted emission, only water is
the by-product.
Today, Hydrogen used in most fuel cells is made from “reforming” methane with high-pressure steam. The steam interacts with the
methane to separate the
hydrogen from the hydroHydrogen Fuel Cell. To see how a fuel cell

The Problem with Fuel Cells

One of the major obstacles in fuel-cell research is designing a safe,
lightweight, and compact hydrogen fuel tank that can store sufficient
amounts of hydrogen.
Hydrogen is a gas, and is not dense, so to store enough of it in a
tank you have to compress it at very high pressures. Another option is to

capacity to absorb large amounts of hydrogen gas in a tank about the
size of an automobile gas tank.
Once the tank is filled up with the hydrogen, the driver would start
the car engine. This action would cause the hydrogen to dislodge from
its storage area, the tank, and float through a hose into the fuel cell. In
the fuel cell, the hydrogen would be converted into electricity and water
vapor. However, while fuel cells look promising, more research will need
to be done before a mass production of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are
on the road.
EMERGING NANOTECHNOLOGIES AND RISKS

Industry and academic experts suggest there is still uncertainty about
the impact of releasing nanoparticles into the environment. It has also
been pointed out that there is a lot more to learn about how nanoparticles behave when they are released into the environment. Like all
emerging technologies with great promise, the nanotechnology and
nanochemistry industries will face challenges in ensuring that environmental risks are properly managed.
NANO INTERVIEW: PROFESSOR PAUL G. TRATNYEK, Ph.D.,
OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY’S OGI SCHOOL
OF SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

Professor Paul G. Tratnyek is an environmental chemist and a professor of environmental and biomolecular systems at Oregon Health &
Science University’s OGI School of Science & Engineering, Beaverton,
Oregon.
Dr. Tratnyek’s research group, along with collaborators at the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory and the University of Minnesota, has
discovered that at least one type of nano-sized particles of iron may be
helpful in cleaning up carbon tetrachloride contamination in groundwater. Carbon tetrachloride is a chemical that is used in dry-cleaning
applications and as a degreasing agent to clean tools. Carbon tetrachloride is a toxic chemical that has shown to cause cancer in animals.
The prospect of using iron nanoparticle technology for environmental cleanup is promising. However, Dr. Tratnyek states that there are a
lot of unanswered questions about the appropriate implementation of
this technology and even some questions about its safety.
Dr. Tratnyek talked to the author about his career and his environmental work in groundwater contamination.

Where did you grow up and what schools did you attend?
I grew up in Sudbury, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. I went
to the public high school and then to Williams College in Western
Massachusetts where I received
my bachelor’s degree. After
Williams College, I went to
the Colorado School of Mines
in Colorado and received my
Ph.D. degree in applied chemistry. The reason I selected
the Colorado School of Mines
to study was because I was
interested in the link between
chemistry and the earth sciences.

What were some of your
favorite activities and subjects
in school?
As a young person in elementary school I was very interested
in the environmental science
activities and natural history.
Through high school and college I focused mainly on the “basics,” i.e., chemistry, physics, and
mathematics. Only in graduate
school did I come back around
to studying environmental science.

How did you get interested in
using iron particles in cleaning
up contaminants in
groundwater?
When I arrived at the Oregon Graduate Institute and became a professor,
one of my senior mentors, another professor in the department, knew
the group in Canada that had first stumbled onto the possibility of using
iron metal to remediate contaminated groundwater. But the group had
difficulty addressing the chemical aspect of that technology. I offered to
help with that, and they provided a small amount of funding for me to
get started. My early results helped explain how the technology worked

and this gave people confidence and boosted the commercial viability
of the technology.
How does groundwater become contaminated?
Groundwater contamination occurs all over the place and comes from
two forms—point sources and nonpoint sources. Point source means
that the contamination was discharged to the environment from some
localized source, such as a dry-cleaning plant or from a factory or business that had a leaking pipe or had spilled the contaminants. Nonpoint
sources include contamination that was distributed broadly across a wide
environment. Pesticides often present nonpoint source contamination
problems because they are introduced to the environment over large
areas, by aerial spraying, or the like.
Nonpoint and point sources are both big problems and it is difficult
at times to know where the source of the contamination came from.
What you usually hear in the news is the point source contamination
cases because you can get names of some companies who buried toxic
materials in their backyards. Many of these are Superfund sites, which
get a lot of press.
What are some of the contaminants found in groundwater and which
ones are the most harmful to human health?
Overall, the most significant contaminants probably are the chlorinated
solvents, which were used in dry cleaning, degreasing, cleaning circuit
boards in the electronic industry, etc. Big and small spills of these chemicals are widespread. The chlorinated solvents are toxic (e.g., some are
carcinogenic) and therefore present real problems when they contaminate groundwater used for drinking purposes. Besides chlorinated solvents, there are other major categories of contaminants: gasoline and
other fuels; metals like chromate, etc.
What is the most common or traditional method that is used for
groundwater remediation?
The most traditional method is referred to as a “pump and treat.” This
involves pumping the groundwater out of the ground and treatment
of the contamination at the surface. Because treatment is done above
ground, it’s called an “ex situ” method.
In this process, a well is put into the ground where there is contaminated groundwater. A pump is attached to the well and if the pumping
is successful it will draw some of the contamination out of the ground to
the surface. Then the contaminants are treated in a variety of different
ways, usually be adsorption to activated carbon filters. The pump and

treat is easy from an engineering standpoint. However, this process is
also criticized as being inefficient for two related reasons. The pump
and treat method tends not to solve the problem, but just controls it.
This means that you have to continue to pump these contaminated areas for a long period. If the well pumps are turned off, the contaminant
concentrations tend to rebound.
The constant daily pumping operation is costly. Ex situ process can
also be tied up in legal and regulatory issues because once the contaminated water is pumped up to the surface you cannot just dump it back
on the ground again because it is hazardous waste, so you need to go
through regulatory and legal requirements to remove it.
You have been studying how iron particles break down pollutants since
1992. One technology you and your colleges helped to develop was the
use of Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs), commonly called “iron
walls,” to remediate contaminated groundwater. In this process,
however, you used macro-sized iron particles. What are iron walls and
what are the advantages of using this process for cleanup rather than
the traditional remediation technologies?
The “iron wall” or permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) has two main
characteristics—it is in situ and it is passive. In situ means that you
apply iron particles by placing them into the ground and treat the
contamination there. You do not have to pump the contaminated water
up to the surface. The other advantage is that this method is passive.
Pump and treat is active because you have to constantly keep the pumps
working. Ideally passive technologies mean that once the treatment is
in place you can cover it up, plant grass, and then you can leave the
area—there is nothing else to do.
Passive can be much less expensive in the long haul than pump and
treat which is an active process. In situ allows you to put iron particles
and materials down into the ground to interact with the groundwater to remove the contaminants. The groundwater will flow through
this treatment zone and be treated and what comes out at the end is
cleaned. The iron wall also serves the function of an in-ground cutoff
wall. This means you can intercept the contaminated groundwater in a
very precise way—you cut it off. This cutoff wall is useful in many ways
where many properties are near one another. So, if someone spills toxic
materials into the ground and contaminates the groundwater, you can
use a cutoff wall to keep the contaminants from entering the groundwater of the nearby neighbor’s property, or discharging into surface
water.

Nanotechnology for a Sustainable Environment

How does iron break down the contaminants?
Traditionally iron walls have been made with granular iron particles that
are the size of millimeters. These coarse iron grains are fairly inexpensive and plentiful. When contaminated water interacts with the metal,
a chemical reaction takes place. The reaction removes the chlorines,
which makes the products less toxic. In a traditional iron wall, the iron
remains available to degrade contaminants pretty much indefinitely.
Do the iron particles have any advantages over the use of other metals
for groundwater remediation?
You can use other metals but iron is better because it is less harmful to
the environment than other metals. Iron is cheaper too. There are two
methods of using iron particles in groundwater remediation.
The traditional way or the most common way of making permeable
iron walls (PRBs) is to use iron particles that are manufactured for the
construction industry. These micron-sized iron particles are coarse and
granular-shaped.
Recently, however, there has been interest in the PRB field in using
nano-sized iron particles for cleaning up contaminants in groundwater.
Nano-sized particles range in size from 10 to 100 nanometers. Much of
this process is similar to the conventional iron wall method for clean up.
However, there are a few differences. The nanoparticles particles are so
small that you can make slurry solutions and then inject the solutions
into the wells. By using this process, you can create an iron wall, but
at a much greater depth than the conventional PRB way. This is huge
advantage. The downside is that when you inject the iron nanoparticles
into the ground, it is not clear how far the particles will move once they
are in the groundwater.
Generally, nanoparticles do not move very far, in fact they do not move
far enough. You want the nanoparticles to move farther. Researchers
are working on ways to make nanoparticles go farther, but if they get
too good at this the particles might move to places we don’t want them
(drinking water supplies, for example). So, we need to do more research
to try to figure out if this PRB process poses a potential problem.
Once these “iron walls” are placed in the soil how long is it before they
need to be replaced?
The installation of the conventional non-nano iron wall has lasted for
some time. There are a good number of iron walls that have worked for
more than 10 years.
We expect that the nanoparticle iron wall installation will not last very
long, because the nanoparticles are so small that they will be used up in a

short time. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate how long the nanoparticle
iron wall will last. Our best estimate is that the nanoparticle iron wall
will probably last only for a few months. The goal of the nanoparticle
iron wall is to knock out the contaminants quickly.
Where have these “iron walls” been used in Oregon and elsewhere?
The convention iron wall (PRBs) was first used by researchers at the
University of Waterloo at a site in Ontario, Canada. In the U.S., the
first large-scale conventional iron wall was used in an industrial park in
Sunnyvale, California. Since then, there have been many applications of
the conventional PRB.
The iron nanoparticle remediation process is much newer and there
are fewer of those that have been implemented. The first pilot program
was initiated by Professor W.X. Zhang at Lehigh University. He established a pilot program at a chemical manufacturing site on the east coast
and reported some favorable results. This was the first pilot-scaled program and since then there have been a number of consulting companies
that have done more than a dozen versions of the nanoparticle iron wall
installations.
Are there any risks in using iron nanoparticles for groundwater
remediation and if so, what would some of these risks be?
There is much debate going on about the use of nanoparticles. The risks
have two parts; one is toxicity and the other part is the exposure part.
Nanoparticles can be toxic, especially if you inhale them, but will there
be any harm to humans and animals? That depends on whether there
is exposure to these iron nanoparticles.
Different situations pose different risks. If you are in the business
of manufacturing these particles then you have occupational health
issues that you need to worry about. However, once you inject these
particles into the ground for remediation there is very little chance that
anyone will be exposed to those iron particles. It is quite clear that these
particles are not very mobile in groundwater because they tend to stick
onto anything available for them to attach to. A general rule is once
you inject these particles into the ground they may move only a few feet
from where you have injected them. So there is little likelihood that the
nanoparticles will show up in the neighbor’s drinking water well that is
300 feet away.
I heard that scrap iron is used to make iron particles used for
groundwater remediation. Is this true? If so, how is it used?
The conventional commercial granular iron micro-particles (not iron
nanoparticles) that are used in a conventional iron wall come from a

variety of scrap metal dealers, many from the Midwest. These materials come from sources like old brake drums. The scrap iron is shredded and then it is cleaned to remove any grease or oil on the metal,
and is sold for a variety of commercial applications such as hardening
concrete.
The iron nanoparticles are not made this way. Iron nanoparticles are
usually made in a process called bottom-up nanofabrication. Nanoparticles start with a solution of iron and some other materials and then
you precipitate the nanoparticles out of the solution starting from the
molecules going to the nanoparticles.
In one of your articles, you described an experiment for
undergraduate general chemistry students. In the experiment, the
students investigated the chemistry behind the iron-permeable reactive
barriers (iron walls) used to remediate contaminated groundwater. Is
this an activity that high school chemistry students could also perform
safely, under supervision, in their science class?
Yes, Students and teachers can refer to a 4-page article, A DiscoveryBased Experiment Illustrating How Iron Metal is Used to Remediate Contaminated Groundwater. For the article, go to: http://cgr.ebs.ogi.edu/merl/
resources.htm
From reading the article, teachers and students can get enough information to investigate the details of the degradation process in the
PRB contaminant system by determining the various parameters for the
degradation of a dye in place of a contaminant. Dyes have often been
used as model contaminants. So, we use a dye in this activity because it
is nontoxic and it works well.
In the activity, students measure the kinetics of the disappearance of
a dye solution in a cuvette containing granular iron particles—not the
iron nanoparticles. There is a nice illustration in the article that shows
the degradation process of the dye. If you wish, you can also monitor
the dye concentration by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. We have
had high school teachers who have worked on several variations of this
activity.

NANO ACTIVITY: DISCOVERING THE PROPERTIES OF
FERROFLUIDS (Teacher Supervision Advised)

Nanotechnologists are experimenting with ferrofluids to help clean
up wastewater. Ferrofluids contain nanoparticles of a magnetic solid,
usually magnetite (Fe3 O4 ), in a colloidal suspension.
NASA discovered ferrofluids when their scientists were trying to control liquid products in space. Ferrofluids have been used in many applications, including computer disk drives, low-friction seals, and loudspeakers.
In this activity, you will learn about some of the properties of ferrofluids. The activity was adapted from the NanoSense Program produced by
the SRI International in Menlo Park, California. Patricia Schank and
Tina Stanford coauthored the activity. To learn more about this nano
activity and other NanoSense activities go to: www.nanosense.org (Safety
Note: You should do the following activity with teacher supervision.)
Materials You Need
1. Sealed display cells of ferrofluids (for ordering, see Where to Buy)
2. Magnet
r Have your teacher show and pass around one or more samples of ferrofluid along with a strong magnet. Under teacher supervision, let students play with the ferrofluids and magnet and see what they can make it
do. The teacher may also want to show and pass around another magnetic
material, like a piece of iron, for comparison. The teacher should explain
to the students that since we have been able to make the particles in the
ferrofluids so small, we have been able to change the physical state of the
material from a solid to a liquid.
r What happens when you bring a magnet close to the liquid?
r When you put the magnet near the ferrofluids, it distorts. What causes
this distortion?

Projects and the
United States
Government
Nanotechnology is expected to have a large impact on many sectors
of the United States and the world’s economy. All governments agree
that a strong nanotechnology economy can lead to new products, new
businesses, new jobs, and even new industries for many countries. As a
result, nanotechnology funding for research is growing rapidly in many
countries.
The U.S. government is aware of the economic and social impacts
that nanotechnology can make. For several decades, the government
has funded nanotechnology research.
NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE

However, a big push for more government investment in nanotechnology research occurred in 2001. At that time, President Clinton requested in the 2002 federal budget a major new initiative, called the
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The budget included an increase of more than 200 million dollars for the government’s investment
in nanotechnology research and development.
Additional nanotechnology dollars were authorized during President
Bush’s term. In December 2003, President Bush signed the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, which authorizes funding for
nanotechnology research and development (R&D) nanotechnology.
This legislation puts into law programs and activities supported by the
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The legislation also authorizes public hearings and expert advisory panels, as well as the American
Nanotechnology Preparedness Center to study the emerging technology’s potential societal and ethical effects.
According to one report, from 2001 to 2007, NNI participants formed
over 60 facilities or institutes involved in nanotechnology research

and development throughout the United States. New centers of nanotechnology expertise, most of which are associated with universities,
train workers and help educate researchers and developers of technology.
Spending on nanotechnology research and development (R&D) has
amounted to several billions of dollars since the late 1990s, by the United
States alone and accounts for a large portion of worldwide spending on
this type of work. The government agencies that have spent the greatest
amounts on nanotechnology are the National Science Foundation, the
Department of Energy, and the Nation Institutes of Health.
In nanotechnology research, engineers, medical doctors, educators, chemists, physicists, nanotechnology researchers usually collaborate on studies and projects. Nanotechnology researchers often must
share equipment, because many of the high-technology microscopes
and other devices used in this technology are too expensive for each
individual research facility to purchase and maintain its own. For example, acquiring a scanning electron microscope and building a cleanroom can cost millions of dollars. So, grants and loans from government and private institutions provide money for such activities and
equipment.
So far, the NNI has already made valuable contributions to the development of nanotechnology. With NNI funding, researchers have been
working on gold nanoshells that can target the destruction of malignant cancer cells (See Chapter 5), low-cost solar cells and quantum dots
for energy sources (See Chapter 6), and nanoscale iron particles that
can reduce the costs of cleaning up contaminated groundwater (See
Chapter 8).

THE NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE (NNI) AND
FEDERAL AGENCIES

The main goal of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is
to coordinate all of the federal agencies’ efforts in nanoscale science,
engineering, and technology. Three of these federal agencies were covered in earlier chapters. They included the Department of Agriculture
in Chapter 7 and the work of the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Department of Energy in Chapter 8.
This chapter will report on nanotechnology research at the National
Science Foundation, Department of Defense, National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Institute of Occupational Safety, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958; this was the time of the then
Soviet Union’s launch of the first artificial satellite. NASA grew out
of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, which had been
researching flight technology for more than 40 years. NASA’s mission
is to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery, and
aeronautics research.
In Chapter 5, you read a little bit about NASA’s lab-on-a-chip.
Lab-on-a-Chip

According to NASA, the lab-on-a-chip technology can be used for new
tools to detect bacteria and life forms on Earth and other planets and

lab-on-a-chip technology approaches are being used for
commercial and medical diagnostic applications. As an example, the labon-a-chip technology can be used as an in-office test for strep throat, or
modern in-home pregnancy tests. The hand-held portable device, containing a simple chip design, can conduct diagnostic tests and record
test results in a short time for the patient.

Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
Spacecraft

In the near future NASA may use combinations of plastics and other
materials that will greatly reduce the weight of a spacecraft. Less weight
in the spacecraft can reduce launch costs.
Carbon fiber technology has already been used to replace many spacecraft components. Presently, the B-2 Stealth Bomber uses carbon fiber
materials in its wings. Carbon fiber composites, for example, are five
times stiffer than steel for the same weight allowing for much lighter
structures. In addition, carbon fibers have the highest thermal conductivity; they do not overheat. This property allows the carbon fibers to
be used as heat dissipating elements on the outside of the craft for
spacecraft reentry protection.

A Self-Repair Spacecraft

Using advanced nanotechnology, the spacecraft may adapt to conditions in space travel by rebuilding itself, as needed, while in
flight. Solar energy from the spacecraft solar panels would power
the computers and assemblers. This would also allow general repair and maintenance to occur without using crew repair astronauts.
Spacecraft Recycling

Recycling aboard the spacecraft will be greatly improved by nanotechnology. Recycling at the atomic level will be very efficient and, in closed
environments, such as space stations, this will be crucial. Nanotechnology should also be able to recycle the air efficiently as well, providing a
high-quality life support system. Recycling water is also well within the
capabilities of nanosystems with all waste molecules being recycled and
used elsewhere.
Improvements in NASA Spacesuits

The new nano-designed spacesuits will be light, thin, comfortable,
and easy to work with but they will have enhanced strength. The suit will
automatically adjust to the contours of the astronaut’s body when it is
put on. The suit will be able to repair itself.
NASA Space Elevator

A space elevator is essentially a long cable extending from the Earth’s
surface to a tower in space. The space elevator will orbit Earth at about
36,000 kilometers in altitude.
Four to six “elevator tracks” would extend up the sides of the
tower and cable platforms, at different levels. These tracks would allow

as a mass transportation system for moving people, payloads, and power between Earth and space.
Security measures are also planned to keep the cable structure from
tumbling to Earth.
Carbon Nanotubes and the Space Elevator. To build such a sky-high elevator, very strong materials would be needed for the cables (tethers)
and the tower. Carbon nanotubes could be the answer for constructing

space elevator needs.
According to NASA researchers, carbon nanotubes are 100 times
stronger than steel. The space elevator will become a realistic possibility
with nanotube fibers that
nanotechnology will provide.

approaches Earth. Using this
material, a cable could be constructed, probably downwards from the
space station.
However, NASA states that the space elevator construction is not feasible today, but it could be toward the end of the 21st century.
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal
agency. Their goal is to promote the progress of science; to advance the
national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense.
NSF funds support basic research conducted by America’s colleges and
universities. About 1,300 projects involving more than 6,000 faculty and
students are supported each year.
The NSF funds the National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN)
and the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). The
NNUN includes five university-based research hubs which are focused on
electronics, biology, advanced materials, optoelectronics, and nanoscale
computer simulation. The NCN, centered at Purdue University, is linking theory and computation to experimental work that helps turn the
promise of nanoscience into new nanotechnologies.
The National Science Foundation funds a number of projects. One
example of a funded nanoproject includes nano research work done
at the University of Akron. Scientists at the University of Akron have
shown how to create a densely packed carpet of carbon nanotubes that
functions like an artificial gecko foot—but with 200 times the gecko
foot’s gripping power. Potential applications include dry adhesives for
microelectronics, information technology, robotics, space, and many
other fields.
Another NSF program that was funded included work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Researchers were able to begin the process of developing nanoscale electronic devices that can be directed to

would allow manufacturers to mass-produce nanochips having circuit
elements only a few molecules across. The mass production of the
nanochips would provide large quantities of chips to be developed with
possible lower costs per unit.

economic security and improve our quality of life. Researchers in NIST’s
develop measurements, standards, and data crucial to private industry’s
development of products for a nanotechnology market that could reach
$1 trillion during the next decade. NIST’s work also aids other federal
agencies’ efforts to exploit nanotechnology to further their missions,
such as national security and environmental protection.
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an agency of the United
States Department of Health and Human Services and is responsible for
regulating
r food,
r dietary supplements,

r drugs and cosmetics,
r biological medical products,
r dietary supplements,
r color additives in food,
r blood products, and
r medical devices.

FDAconducts research in several of its Centers to understand the characteristics of nanomaterials and nanotechnology processes. Research interests include any areas related to the use of nanoproducts that FDA
needs to consider in the regulation of these products. As an example
of current research, FDA is collaborating with other agencies on studies
that examine the skin absorption and phototoxicity of nano-sized titanium dioxide and zinc oxide preparations used in sunscreens. If any
risks are identified, which may occur from these nano chemicals used in
sunscreens, then additional tests or other requirements may be needed.
FDA only regulates certain categories of products. Existing requirements may be adequate for most nanotechnology products that we will
regulate. These products are in the same size-range as the cells and
molecules that FDA reviewers and scientists associate with every day.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD)

The mission of the Department of Defense is to provide the military
forces that are needed to deter war and to protect the security of the
United States. The department’s headquarters is at the Pentagon.

The DOD has a long history of supporting innovative nanotechnology research efforts for the future advancement of warfighter and battle
systems capabilities. The DOD includes the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA), Office of Naval Research (ONR), Army Research Office (ARO), and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
(AFOSR).
Since the mid-1990s, DOD identified nanoscience as a strategic research area that would require a substantial amount of basic research
funding on a long-term basis. The potential of nanotechnology applications will impact many areas for future warfighting. Some of these
areas include chemical and biological warfare defense, a reduction in
the weight of warfighting equipment, high-performance information
technology, and uninhabited vehicles and miniature satellites.
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

The Department of Homeland Security is a federal agency whose
primary mission is to help prevent, protect against, and respond to acts
of terrorism on U.S. soil. The Department of Homeland Security has
the capability to anticipate, preempt, and deter threats to the homeland
whenever possible, and the ability to respond quickly when such threats
do materialize.
As the United States focuses on protecting and defending against
terrorism, scientists are conducting research in antiterrorist technology.
One of the programs is to develop new kinds of nanoscale sensors to
detect explosives and hazardous chemicals at the nanometer level. Most
experts agree that sensors are critical to all of the homeland security
strategies.
Nanoscale sensors, with their small, lightweight size will improve the
capability to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive or
CBRE agents. The use of nanoscale sensors for CBRE can be deployed
for advance security to
r transportation systems (protection for air, bus, train/subway, etc.);

r military (protection for facilities, equipment and personnel);
r federal buildings (White House, U.S. embassies, and all other federal
buildings);
r customs (for border crossings, international travel, etc.);
r civilian businesses; and schools.

Further research will yield sensor technologies that are cheaper and
lighter yet far more sensitive, selective, and reliable than current systems.

answering questions that are essential to understanding safe approaches
to nanotechnology. Some of these questions include:
r Are workers exposed to nanomaterials in the manufacture and use of
nanomaterials, and if so what are the characteristics and levels of exposures?
r What effects might nanoparticles have on the body’s systems?
r Are there potential adverse health effects of working with nanomaterials?
r What work practices, personal protective equipment, and engineering
controls are available, and
r How effective are they for controlling exposures to nanomaterials?

NIOSH believes that the answer to these questions is critical for supporting the responsible development of nanotechnology and for maintaining competitiveness of the United States in the growing and dynamic
nanotechnology market.
NIOSH publishes a document called Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology. The document reviews what is currently known about nanoparticle
toxicity and control. The document serves as a request from NIOSH to
occupational safety and health practitioners, researchers, product innovators and manufacturers, employers, workers, interest group members,
and the general public to exchange information that will ensure that no
worker suffers material impairment of safety or health as nanotechnology develops.

NANO INTERVIEW: LAURA BLASI, Ph.D., AND NASA’S VIRTUAL LAB

Dr. Laura Blasi has been committed to the pursuit of equity in education, focused on evaluation in K-12 education and at the college-level.

of technology for teaching and learning. She has collaborated with
colleagues at the Association of American Colleges and Universities
(AAC&U) and at the University of Virginia’s Center for Technology

and Teacher Education (CTTE). In collaboration with her colleague
Dr. Dan Britt, she is currently working on “To Infinity and Beyond”
which emphasizes the history and role of telescopes and microscopes
in the exploration of space, funded by NASA’s Space Telescope Science
Institute (STScI).
Dr. Blasi is a member of Project Kaleidoscope: Faculty for the 21st
Century (F21), a national network of emerging leaders in undergraduate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) focused on transforming the environment for learning for undergraduate
students in mathematics and the various fields of science. Dr. Laura
Blasi is currently an evaluation specialist at Saint Leo University near
Tampa, Florida, working with faculty members in science to integrate
NASA’s Virtual Lab at the college-level and with faculty members in
math to transform entry-level courses to support student success. While
at the University of Central Florida (UCF) for the past 4 years, Dr. Laura
Blasi’s research had focused on high school science in low-income classrooms, specifically using the Virtual Lab simulation developed by NASA
Kennedy Space Center.
You have been working with NASA’s Virtual Lab, tell us more
about this . . .
The Virtual Lab is a suite of simulations of advanced microscopes, including the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM); Fluorescence Light
Microscope; Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (for the SEM); and an
Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). There are a range of specimens accessible through these tools, such as the eye of a housefly, euglena,
an integrated circuit, and lunar dust. The Virtual Lab was developed by
NASA within the Learning Technologies Project (LTP), and the software
was designed and built by the Beckman Institute.
The software was refined using the findings from a study I conducted
funded by the BellSouth Foundation in low socioeconomic schools using
the Virtual Lab. The study documented the use of the Virtual Lab software within tenth grade science classrooms in the 2004–2005 school year
(n=225) in low socioeconomic status areas in Orange County, Florida,
while contributing to the further development of the program.
Working with my colleague, Theresa Martinez, at NASA Kennedy Space
Center (KSC), we recently launched Cogs (Connecting a Generation
to Science) on the Web (http://www.nasa-inspired.org/). This project
seeks to develop materials to support the systemic integration of NASA’s
Virtual Lab into middle and high school classrooms nationally.

We developed Cogs from requests for support made by teachers
when we piloted the Virtual Lab. While Cogs includes the Virtual Lab
download and teaching materials to support the use of this simulation,
teachers can post requests for new specimens to be added or they can
ask questions that can be addressed by experts in the field.
How did the Virtual Lab develop?
A team from NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) led by Berta Alfonso
proposed this Virtual Lab. The Virtual Lab concept was proposed in
response to educators’ requests to provide students access to NASA’s
instruments. Many of these instruments are too costly for schools and
colleges to purchase and maintain. Specifically, this need was voiced
within our discussions with Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) in the United States.
By providing simulations of these microscopes, we could meet these
needs in a way that did not conflict with KSC operations and security.
By providing this software freely to all, NASA could also ensure equal
access and availability to the local community, the nation, and beyond
borders across the globe. Theresa Martinez now heads up the NASA KSC
overseeing the Virtual Lab. We described the development of the Virtual
Lab at length in the journal Simulation and Gaming last year (2006).
How did you get involved with the Virtual Lab?
I became involved as an independent evaluator. With funding from
the BellSouth Foundation working with talented graduate students in
the UCF College of Education, I conducted a usability study in three
Orange County public schools that serve low-income communities using
the Virtual Lab software in Florida. The schools were low performers
on the state standardized tests for 3 or more years prior. So we were
not focused on Advanced Placement students in mathematics and the
sciences at well-funded schools for public relations purposes—we really
wanted to know what was happening and if the technology could be
improved to meet the needs of the students and teachers.
The Virtual Lab allows students and teachers to work individually
with very sophisticated scientific instruments. These tools from NASA
are free of cost and cannot be broken. They allow science teachers
to teach science using a hands-on approach rather than only through
lecture or textbook reading. This is the reason it was important for
me to work within low-income schools, which provide access to the
classroom conditions that are experienced across the country. If the
limited access to technology is not addressed systemically in education,
it will be difficult to reach the goals for the development and use of

advanced technologies that we imagine setting and achieving over the
next 10 years in the United States.
Can teachers become involved with the Virtual Lab project?
Yes, while teachers use the simulation in their classrooms, we also have
had teachers then go on to train others in their schools. The Virtual
Lab has also been developed for use in professional development for
teachers in science and math, with the idea that teachers will more likely
incorporate it if they have experience using and integrating the Virtual
Lab into their lesson plans.
The interface includes annotation and measuring tools (from millimeters to microns) and the integration of the software can support
student preparation for standardized tests in mathematics and the sciences. The Virtual Lab is also used at the college level in the sciences, it
is not limited in its design but instead it replicates the actual microscope
interfaces.
With this context in mind we have been developing Cogs, so that high
school and middle school teachers can browse, print, and even create
resources and lesson plans related to the Virtual Lab. The Cogs project
also gives teachers access to related animations and videos on the tools
themselves, their use, and careers in the field.
What are the career paths available for Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education that emerged in the
development of the Virtual Lab?
There are a few that may not be thought of as options for middle
and high school students, simply because they are evolving with this
generation and were not featured in the options that many teachers
had available to them. Artists and programmers who created the Virtual Lab provide examples of emerging careers in design and development. Scientists and engineers worked as subject matter experts, providing information and insights—as well as virtual specimens for our
project.
There are other roles for evaluators, teachers, and project directors
directly related to STEM education, and these are roles that I have had
throughout this project. It’s important to keep in mind that both women
and men are pushing the frontiers of this work. Career counseling and
advising in high school and in college will play a large role when working
toward these kinds of STEM careers, but earlier exploration paired with
guidance is better to develop the necessary skills for success. In terms of
nanotechnology, while aiming for specific goals in terms of the economic
competitiveness of the United States, we also need to focus on ways

students today can be part of the effort to improve the pathways toward
those goals.
While the Virtual Lab can be used in middle, high school, and college
classrooms, can programmers, scientists, and other researchers also get
involved?
Yes, definitely. The Cogs Web site offers a place for microscopists to
view requested specimens and to discuss ways of contributing to the
project. Dr. Glenn Fried and Dr. Ben Grosser and their colleagues at the
Beckman Institute who developed the software also have made sure that
the architecture is open source on SourceForge. Defined in XML code,
the Virtual Lab can be easily expanded by the developer community
(see: http://virtual.itg.uiuc.edu/software/).
From your perspective, what role can the Virtual Lab play as we seek to
prepare students in the United States to fuel innovation in the field of
nanotechnology research and development?
The Virtual Lab specifically allows students to see objects that are familiar
and relevant to everyday living at the level of millimeters and microns.
In order to think and work at the level of nanometers, students need
to understand the concept of scale while also experiencing the level of
detail possible through advanced microscopy.
More generally in terms of careers in STEM, both men and women
need to approach study as an active experience that they can do rather
than as a secondary report that they can read about. The Virtual Lab
allows students to experience first-hand investigation guided by their
teachers using equipment that was once out-of-reach for almost all
schools in terms of space available for equipment and expense.
There will continue to be debate over the ways to best prepare students
for STEM careers, just as there will be debate over the role of virtual labs
in education. We need to be clear that in both cases there are conclusive
research findings and we are able to act on them. Overall, the Virtual
Lab allows more diverse populations access to advanced microscopes
across all socioeconomic status (SES) levels when adequate technology
access and support is available.

In Chapter 1, Dr. Mihail Roco, a senior adviser for nanotechnology at the
NSF’s National Nanotechnology, said that companies building products
at the atomic level eventually would face a serious shortage of talent—far
worse than what is already occurring.
Dr. Roco estimated about 2 million nanotech-trained workers will be
needed to support growing industries and the startups they start within
the next 10 to 15 years. He emphasized that the country needs to find
ways to motivate students about sciences and to make them aware of the
career opportunities in nanotechnology fields.
Based on the need to employ 2 million nanotechnology-savvy workers
by 2015, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is pushing for children
between the ages of 10 and 17 to become educated now about the
field of nanotechnology.

how they are helping the young people understand nanotechnology and
to explore careers in this emerging field.
AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. NANCY HEALY, EDUCATION
COORDINATOR OF THE NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK (NNIN)

One of the major groups that is providing state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities and resources to schools and colleges is the National
Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN). The author had an
opportunity to talk with Dr. Healy during a phone interview about her
professional career as the Education Coordinator of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN). Dr. Healy’s office is located at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.
The NNIN is a National Science Foundation funded program, which
supports nanoscience researchers by providing state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities, support, and resources. The NNIN is a consortium of
thirteen universities across the United States (http://www.nnin.org). In
addition to researcher support, the NNIN has a large and integrated
education and outreach program.
What is your role as the Education Coordinator of the National
Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network?
The NNIN education programs focus on the development of a nanoready workforce as well as development of a nano-literate public.
Outreach efforts span elementary-level students through adults. The
NNIN provides a variety of programs which include: summer camps
for middle and high school students; on-site and off-site school
visits which include laboratory tours, hands-on activities, demonstrations, and presentations; summer research experiences for undergraduates and K-12 teachers; workshops for K-12 teachers; K-12 instructional materials development; workshops/seminars for undergraduates;
community college programs; symposia at national meetings; workshops for faculty, industry, and government personnel (lifelong learning); and a Web site for accessing information on our resources and
programs.
Where did you grow up and what were your favorite subjects
in high school?
I grew up in Greenville, Rhode Island, and my favorite subjects in high
school were science and history. I wanted to be an archaeologist so I
could combine the two subjects.

Colleges and Schools and Nanotechnology

What college did you attend and what was your major?
I attended University of Rhode Island for my undergraduate degree
in zoology and then I received a master’s degree and Ph.D. degree in
geology at the University of South Carolina.
How did you get interested in a career in nanotechnology education?
I don’t think anyone working in nanotechnology education had a
straight path in this career. I knew about nanotechnology when I was in
South Carolina working for the state agency that oversaw all the colleges
and universities. We had just approved the Nano Center at the University of South Carolina. So I learned about the field of nanotechnology.
Around the same time, I found out that Georgia Tech wanted somebody
to coordinate this new program in nanotechnology education and outreach (NNIN). They wanted someone with an interdisciplinary science
background, which is what I had, and someone who had an understanding of teacher professional development in K-12 math and science. I
applied and I received my new position in July 2004.
You were quoted in an article, “People generally don’t know what
nanotechnology really is. There’s a risk that their perceptions will be
based on popular culture portrayals of it rather than fact.” What are
some ways to help the general population to be able to separate
nanotechnology fact from fiction?
I really think it is the responsibility of researchers, whether they are
in the university, in government, or in industry to make sure that the
public knows what is true and what is not true about any field, whether
it is nanotechnology, biomedicine, or aeronautics. Researchers and scientists need to engage the public about what they are doing. One way
of communicating this to the public is to have scientists address various
clubs and organizations such as the rotary clubs. Having nanotechnology forums in schools and campuses is another way to educate the
public. I think it is very important to work with the media, too. Scientists
have the responsibility to make sure their science reported in the media is accurate and correct, and to correct any misconceptions in their
work.
What are some of the benefits in nanotechnology? What are some of
the ethical or societal issues?
One major benefit will be in the microelectronic and telecommunication fields. Our whole electronic world will be faster and smaller and will
consume much less energy than we do now. Another benefit will be in
the area of nanomedicine. This is a huge area. We will see some amazing

things happening in biomedical applications, particularly in such areas
as cancer detection and treatment.
On social and ethical issues, I
think one of the major concerns
is about the production of materials using nanoparticles. The question is, “will the nanoparticles
be the next asbestos problem?”
There is research that says yes
they are harmful, but I have spoken with other researchers who
point out that some of these studies are not done well. So it is very
important that good studies and
good science be done in this
area of concern. No one wants
to breathe in bad stuff into our
lungs, but everyday we intake particles from vehicle exhausts. So
will the Buckyballs be any more
harmful than the soot that comes
out of the exhausts from vehicles? That is a study that needs to

could occur between the haves
and have-nots. In other words,
will the industrialized nations get all this technology, and in doing so,
bypass those countries that are poorer? This issue needs to be addressed
by everyone in the industry and that includes the scientists, ethicists,
and the lawyers.
In the past the NNIN has presented programs at the National Science
Teachers Association to inform teachers about nanotechnology. What
kind of presentation have you done?
In NNIN, we have a program called the NNIN Research Experience
for Teachers (NNIN RET). The teachers who were participants in this
program have presented instructional nanotechnology units at the

NSTA meetings. The teachers developed these units as a result of their
summer nanotechnology research experiences at such colleges as Georgia Tech, Harvard, Howard University, Penn State, and the University
of California, Santa Barbara. In 2006, 19 teachers participated in the
NNIN RET and their units were presented to schoolteachers at the 2007
NSTA. After the presentations, the schoolteachers visited our NSTA exhibit booth to review the units and to get additional information. These
units are posted or will be posted on our Web site.
One teacher, from Gwinnett County, Georgia, created a physics and
literature unit based on material in the Ratner and Ratner book, Nanotechnology, A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea. Even though she
teaches advanced placement physics, she included literature materials
into the unit. Then, she brought the unit to the elementary grades by
having her students create books on what the future will be like with
nanotechnology. In the beginning, the NNIN RET involved all high
school teachers with physics and chemistry backgrounds. We now have
added middle school teachers with backgrounds in physical science and
in basic biology.
The NNIN program sponsors volunteers who go to local schools and
work with student groups who visit the Georgia Tech Campus. What
kinds of activity lessons do they present? Are any of these lessons
available for teachers?
Yes, lessons are available to teachers. As an example, we have our “Modeling Self-Assembly” lesson and another lesson on hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties posted on the education portal. We are now preparing and working on another 20 units that will be available to teachers.
We also have a teacher resource flyer that we hand out to
teachers and that flyer is available on the Georgia Tech Web site
(http://www.mirc.gatech.edu/education.php). The NNIN goal is to
provide information to teachers so they can go to one place for specific information on nanotechnology units, such as a chemistry unit,
that they can use in their classes.
The NNIN program has a variety of summer camps for high-school
aged students. What do the students learn at these camps?
Every camp we have provides an introduction to nanotechnology. We
give the kids an understanding of what nano is and where it is going.
Every camp has information on education and career opportunities. So,
kids get an idea what the field is, where it is going, and what jobs will
be available. All the camps bring the kids into some kind of laboratory
facility. At Georgia Tech, they visit at least three research laboratories
learning about what the researchers are doing in their own labs. Students

also visit a cleanroom facility to learn how it is used in nanotechnology. At
some camps, students can do microchip preparation using a cleanroom.
The camps provide a lot of exposure in the nanotechnology field.
Do students at these camps have access to different kinds
of electron microscopes?
Yes, at some camps. We are moving into this area of developing ways
for students to access Atomic Force Microscopes and Scanning Electron
Microscopes. Some groups at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
have been able to remotely use the AFM at Penn State.
We had a group of high school students come in and use our AFM
and our SEM microscopes at Georgia Tech. These microscopes allowed
the students to go down and look at miniscule amounts of matter. We
are also looking at ways to use remote access to these microscopes, too.
Penn State has an animation of how a scanning electron microscope
is used. This animation, Amazing Creatures with Nanoscale Features, is

properties. It introduces some of the tools that are used by scientists to visualize samples that are smaller than what we can see with
our eyes. This activity is available for use via the Center’s Web site at
http://www.cneu.psu.edu/edToolsActivities.html.
I learned that one college had a nanotechnology career day and it
attracted more than 300 school-age students. The NNIN also has
career days. What are some of the advantages for students to attend
these kinds of career day events?
We do something called Nanoinfusion at Georgia Tech. This event is
pretty much like a career day. At one of these events, we had about 375
eighth grade students split between 2 days for about 4 hours each day.
The activities of a nano career day, or field trip to a facility, depends on
which facility they visit and the duration of the visit. Typically there are
hands-on activities and demonstrations, lectures, and tours. The advantage of all these nano career days is that it gets kids on a college campus,
and for many, to see a college campus for the first time. While on campus,
the students can interact with graduate students and faculty members.
To excite students, the career day should have a tie-in with something
that has real-world applications which is what we strive to provide our
visitors.
Diana Palma, the Assistant NNIN Education Coordinator at Georgia
Tech, is the one who developed and organized Nanoinfusion. She can
keep 150–175 kids busy during a 3–4 hour visit. The students visit our
facility and they go to a series of stations that are set up where they get
to see either a demonstration or do a hands-on activity at each station.
Then they move on in groups to experience different things, such as a
cleanroom tour or a laboratory tour. For the first Nanoinfusion, we had
15 research labs on campus participate and 70 volunteers to assist the
students. At the end, we may have them create an advertising piece or
commercial based on a nanotechnology product that they have seen
or a possible product from someone’s research. They get exposed to a
whole range of things during their visit.
NNIN has featured on its Web site a number of features that are
directed to students and teachers. A partial list includes
Nanotechnology Careers, Nanotechnology Tools, Nanotechnology
Products, Seeing Nanostructures and even a children’s science
magazine called Nanooze. Is the NNIN planning to add any additional
educational topics?
We are planning on a few more features and to provide additional nanotechnology educational units on the NNIN Web site for K-12 teachers.

What would your advice be for high school students who wish to
explore a career in nanotechnology?
At the high school level, students need to take a minimum of 3 years of
science and mathematics. They need to explore some of the career and
educational options that are available in this field. I wish more states
would duplicate the program at Penn State. Penn State has a special
program where students can obtain a two-year degree in nanotechnology
(at a local community college with a capstone semester at Penn State)
and then go on to a 4-year program if they want to pursue further
education. Students should know that they do not need to have a Ph.D.
degree to work in the field of nanotechnology research. As with any
field, there are all kinds of opportunities. At the technical level, they
could be maintaining vacuum pumps in a lab or learning how to do
different fabrication processes in the cleanroom. You can be a lawyer
and be involved with nanotechnology perhaps as a patent lawyer. You
can be a graphic artist or a businessperson on the entrepreneurial side.
But you need to have some basic understanding of the interactions of
all the sciences and engineering. One of the units we have up on our
Web site, which is our nanoproducts unit, includes an extension activity
on careers. The unit provides the students with a number of sites they
can visit to explore career opportunities. We eventually plan to have on
our Web site a whole unit on exploring nanotechnology careers.

NATIONAL SCIENCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION
AND EXPLORAVISION

Each year, several elementary, middle school, and high schools have
entered science projects in a program called ExploraVision, which is
sponsored by the Toshiba Corporation and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). The ExploraVision is designed for K–12 students of all interest, skill, and ability levels. ExploraVision encourages
students to create and explore a vision of future technology by combining their imaginations with the tools of science.
Since 1992, more than 200,000 students from across the United States
and Canada have competed in ExploraVision. For many of the participants ExploraVision can be the beginning of a lifelong adventure in
science, as students develop higher-order thinking skills and learn to
think about their role in the future.
Each year there are several schools that explore a future vision of
nanotechnology. As an example, in Chapter 5, the author interviewed

students who were winners of the ExploraVision Program. There have
been other ExploraVision nanotechnology winners over the past years.
Here is a short list of some of those schools that participated in the
ExploraVision program.
ExploraVision Project

The Tumor-nator, Mr. Paul Octavio Boubion. Mr. Paul Octavio
Boubion is an eighth-grade physical science teacher at the Carl H. Lorbeer Middle School, in Diamond Bar, California. I asked Mr. Boubion
to comment on his experiences in the nanotechnology field and the
ExploraVision program. Here is what he had to say.
I got interested nanotechnology from my brother-in-law, Timothy Ryan, PhD.
who is a research scientist at Cornell University. Dr. Ryan is a neurophysicist
and has inspired me with his research and discoveries. He is a wealth of
information about a wide variety of scientific topics and my “lifeline” when I
have a question.
I have also been inspired by the creative topics my students have researched for Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision contest each year. The best
entries my students have submitted in the past seem to be nanotech
related.
The “Tumor-nator” was a Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision project and was
one of the main inspirations as a teacher. The four 8th graders worked on
this project for months and I provided as much help as I could. The students
learned more about science through their research than all they learned in
middle school.
The students project, Tumor-nator, received a Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision Honorable Mention in 2005. The tumor-nator targets malignant tumors
in the body and repairs the P53 gene in the DNA of cancer cells. The P53 gene
triggers cell death in the life cycle of a healthy cell. Then, T-cells can work to remove the cells using the body’s own natural processes. The Tumor-nator treatment also contains, interferon, which stimulates T-cell production in the body.
My advice for students who want to explore a career in nanotechnology
is to take their laboratory training very seriously so they are prepared to do
science, not merely earn a grade.

You can contact Mr. Boubion at this email: paul.boubion@pusd.org

the award-winning ExploraVision project, the Appy-Bot. The following
includes her comments,
The Appy-Bot will eliminate the need for appendectomies in the future by
using nanotechnology to repair a patient’s appendix.
Normally, nanotechnology wouldn’t be a science studied at the elementary
school level, but the national science competition, ExploraVision provides
a forum that challenges students and teachers to go beyond the classroom
curriculum.
During the 2004–2005 school year, a team of three fifth graders wanted to
create a future technology that would eliminate the need for appendectomies.
The Pediatric Surgeon who performed an appendectomy on one of the team
members came in and shared what was happening to the appendix before
surgery. He also encouraged the team to do some research on nanobots. They
went on-line and learned about nanobots and nanotechnology.
The next part of the design process took them to the University of Buffalo where they met with professors in Chemical and Biological Engineering.
One professor felt that the team’s initial concept for the Appy-Bot had too
many functions for it to be nano-sized and encouraged them to create micromachines. The competition required them to look 20 years into the future,

and they felt that micro-machines were not futuristic enough. They also discovered that the 2020s were going to be the “Golden Age of Nanobots,” which
would be the perfect time to launch their idea. The team left that professor’s
office disheartened, but ran into another professor from that department Mrs.
Gentner had used before. He took them to a conference room and “really”
helped them to understand through analogies and some math calculations
just how small a nano was. Their project went through its final revision, and
became a fleet of millions to billions of nanobots in a gel cap someone would
swallow. There would be two types of Appy-Bots. One type would suck in
surrounding liquids, flushing out the obstruction to the appendix, while the
other would pick away at it.
The team took 2nd Place in the Nationals. National Winners and their
Web sites/projects are posted on the ExploraVision Web site (http://www.

Again, you asked how important nanotechnology is in the subject I teach.
As you can see, it was extremely rewarding in its application to ExploraVision

challenges, and future science. Due to the abstract nature of nano science
though, not all students at the elementary level would be as ready as this
team was in its application. Plus, most of the science taught at this level
concerns itself with present science, and doesn’t usually take a problem-solving
approach. This was real-life application!
I think that the possibilities of what nanotechnology can do for medicine
in the future and people in general are truly exciting. But, we have to take
a different approach to science in elementary schools, where students are
applying what they learn in the classroom to authentic questions/problems.

How did you get interested nanotechnology?
For many years, I have worked with Northwestern University Professor
Robert Chang on the Materials Worlds Modules curriculum program.
When NU became a partner in the first national center for learning and
teaching of nanoscale science and engineering education in the United
States (NCLT), I became interested in nanotechnology and facilitated
summer professional development opportunities for high school teachers in nanoscience.
Describe some of your teaching experience in developing the
nanotechnology project.
For many years, I have had students enter the Toshiba ExploraVision
competition. Working in groups to simulate research and development
teams, students select a current technology and after researching its
history and present, creatively project what the technology will look
like in 20 years. They predict what breakthroughs will be needed to
realize the vision as well as examining the possible positive and negative
consequences of the new technology.
Each year, several of my student teams would earn honorable mention
awards, and all of these winning projects incorporated nanotechnology
in the vision. So more recently, I started actively teaching a nanotechnology unit before the project and encouraged all students to use nanotechnology concepts in their ExploraVision papers. The project Fighting
Cancer with Nano-Shells earned an honorable mention in 2006.
How important is the field of nanotechnology in the subject you teach?
I think nanotechnology has the potential of teaching students the how
of science. Often we tell students what we know without telling them how
we know. In the nanoscience unit that I teach, students build a model
of an atomic force microscope after learning about atomic structure.
What advice would you give students who want to explore a career
in nanotechnology?
I would tell them that nanotechnology is the future of science and that
the worldwide need for nanotechnology workers is expected to reach 2
million by 2015.
Can you provide a Web site or recommend a one where our readers
would be able to access more information about your project work?
Yes, I can. Here are a few of them.
www.exploravsion.org has information on the contest as well as Web
sites of past winning papers. Here is another Web site:
